# Allowing elmah.io uptime agents

elmah.io Uptime Monitoring runs in 9 different regions. Depending on which regions you enabled on each uptime check, your network infrastructure/firewall, or security settings, you may need to allow requests from elmah.io uptime agents.

You can allow requests by allowing all requests with the following user-agent:

```
User-Agent: elmahio-uptimebot/2.0
```

Or you can allow requests based on an IP. Here's an overview of possible inbound IP addresses by region.
