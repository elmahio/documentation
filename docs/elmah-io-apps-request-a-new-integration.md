# Request a new integration between elmah.io and another tool

We are always on the lookout for creating new and useful integrations. We don't want to integrate with everything (that's what Zapier is for), but commonly used tools by .NET web developers are on our radar.

To suggest a new integration feel free to reach out through the support widget in the lower right corner.

!!! note
    Not all integration requests are implemented. Don't feel bad if we decide not implement your suggestion.

When recommending a new integration we need the following information:

- Name of the tool.
- URL of the tool.
- Why do you need this integration?
- What do you expect from this integration?
- Does the tool provide an API?
- Anything else you think would help?
- Do you by any chance know anyone working on the tool?
