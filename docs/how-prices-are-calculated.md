# How prices are calculated

When using elmah.io, you may experience the need to switch plans, update your credit card, or do other tasks which will require changes to your subscription. This document explains the different upgrade/downgrade and payment paths.

## Switch to a higher plan

You can switch to a larger plan at all times. If you purchased a Small Business ($29) on June 1 and want to upgrade to Business ($49) on June 15, we charge you ~ $35. You already paid $15 for half of June on the Small Business plan, so the remaining amount is deducted from the $49. Your next payment will be on July 15.

## Switch to a lower plan

You can switch to a lower plan when your current subscription is renewed. If you purchased a Business plan ($49) on June 15. and downgrade to a Small Business plan ($29) on July 1, you would be charged $49 on June 15, and $29 on July 15. You commit to either a month or a year in advance.

## Update your credit card

A new credit card can be inputted at any time during your subscription. The payment provider will automatically charge the new credit card on the next payment.

## Purchase a top-up

If you need additional messages but don't want to upgrade to a larger plan permanently, you can purchase a top-up. The purchase is made on the credit card already configured on the subscription. If you want to buy the top-up on a different credit card, you will need to use the *Update credit card* feature first. The price of the top-up is always $19, and you can purchase as many top-ups as you want.

## Switch payment interval

Switching from monthly to annual or annual to monthly is possible. If you switch from monthly to annual, you are charged the difference between the two plans as in [Switch to a higher plan](#switch-to-a-higher-plan). If you switch from annual to monthly, one of two scenarios can happen. If you switch to the same plan or lower, your plan will automatically switch when your current subscription renews (like in [Switch to a lower plan](#switch-to-a-lower-plan)). If you switch to a higher plan, your plan will switch immediately as in [Switch to a higher plan](#switch-to-a-higher-plan). If the price of the remaining time on your current plan covers the price of the new plan, the exceeding amount will be credited to your balance and used to pay for the new plan and any upcoming invoices. Paying for top-ups with the balance is currently not supported.

## Purchase a subscription from Denmark

We are based in Denmark, why selling services to another Danish company requires us to include 25% VAT (moms). The price on the various dialogs will automatically show the price including VAT as well as the VAT amount. Your invoices will include the amount in VAT to inform SKAT.
