# Missing server side information on uptime errors

To decorate uptime errors with server side error information, you will need a few things:

1. The monitored website should be configured to log errors to elmah.io.
2. The uptime check needs to be created on the same log as the monitored website.
3. Update the BotBuster app. When installed in a previous version, errors generated by Uptime Monitoring are ignored (since [Uptime Monitoring](https://elmah.io/features/uptime-monitoring/) is in fact a bot). To update, uninstall the BotBuster app and then re-install it.
