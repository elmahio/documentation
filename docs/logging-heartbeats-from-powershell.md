# Logging heartbeats from PowerShell

The Heartbeats feature is a great way to verify that scripts run successfully too. A lot of people have PowerShell scripts running on a schedule to clean up folders on the file system, make batch changes in a database, and more.

To include heartbeats in your PowerShell script, wrap the code in `try/catch` and add either `Healthy` or `Unhealthy` result:

```powershell
$apiKey = "API_KEY"
$logId = "LOG_ID"
$heartbeatId = "HEARTBEAT_ID"
$url = "https://api.elmah.io/v3/heartbeats/$logId/$heartbeatId/?api_key=$apiKey"

try
{
    # Your script goes here

    $body = @{
        result = "Healthy"
    }
    Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $url -Body ($body|ConvertTo-Json) -ContentType "application/json-patch+json"
}
catch
{
    $body = @{
        result = "Unhealthy"
        reason = $_.Exception.Message
    }
    Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $url -Body ($body|ConvertTo-Json) -ContentType "application/json-patch+json"
}
```

If everything goes well, a `Healthy` heartbeat is logged using the `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlet. If an exception is thrown in your script, an `Unhealthy` heartbeat is logged.
