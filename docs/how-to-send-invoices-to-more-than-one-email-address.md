# How to send invoices to more than one email address

elmah.io currently only supports sending invoices to a single email address. You can have it delivered to multiple email addresses in one of the following ways (and probably more):

- Set up an email group covering multiple email addresses and use the group's email as the *Accountant Email* in elmah.io.
- Set up an automated forward rule on the email address registered as *Accountant Email* in elmah.io.
