# How do I view my account/profile information

Your elmah.io account consists of your personal user account and your organization account. You can access your personal account information available on the [Profile](https://app.elmah.io/profile/) page. You can update basic information about yourself, upload a profile photo, and configure how elmah.io should work for you.

On the organization profile page, you can update information about your organization such as the company name, address, VAT number, etc. Organization information is used on generated quotes, invoices, and other organization-related information. The organization profile can be accessed by users with *Admin* access to the organization by clicking the gears icon next to the organization name on either the [Dashboard](https://app.elmah.io/dashboard/) or in the left menu.
