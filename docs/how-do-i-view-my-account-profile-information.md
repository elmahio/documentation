# How do I view my account/profile information

Your elmah.io account is split between your personal user account and your organization account. Everyone can access their own account information available on the [Profile](https://app.elmah.io/profile/) page. You can update basic information about yourself, upload a profile photo, and configure how elmah.io should work for you.

On the organization profile page, you can update information about your organization like the name of the company, address, VAT number, etc. Organization information is used on generated quotes, invoices, and similar related to the organization. The organization profile can be accessed by users with *Admin* access to the organization by clicking the gears icon next to the organization name on either the [Dashboard](https://app.elmah.io/dashboard/) or in the left menu.
