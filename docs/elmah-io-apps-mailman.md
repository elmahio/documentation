The Mailman app for elmah.io sends out an email to an address of your choice, every time a new error is logged.

Input a valid email address in the _Email_ input box and click _Save_.

The Mailman app will look at new errors only. Errors are defined by messages with a severity of `Error` or `Fatal` and with `isNew == true`. `isNew` is a field automatically added by elmah.io when indexing each message. `isNew` is calculated by looking for similarities between the new message and already logged messages.
