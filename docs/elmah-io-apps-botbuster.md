The BotBuster app for elmah.io identifies and ignores messages generated by white hat bots like spiders, search engine bots, and similar. Under normal circumstances, you want to allow access for white hat bots, but you don't want to get a notification every time one of them tries to request a resource not found on the server.

Installing BotBuster couldn't be simpler. Log into elmah.io and go to the log settings. Click the Apps tab. Locate the BotBuster app and click the *Install* button.
