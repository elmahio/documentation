# Logging to elmah.io from Web Pages

Logging from ASP.NET Web Pages uses our integration with ELMAH (the open-source project). This means that the installation is identical to installing elmah.io in ASP.NET Web Forms.

For a full guide to installing the `Elmah.Io` NuGet package in your Web Pages project go to: [Logging to elmah.io from ASP.NET / WebForms](logging-to-elmah-io-from-elmah.md).

If the dialog requesting you to input an API key and a Log ID is not shown during the installation of the NuGet package, ELMAH configuration needs to be checked manually as explained here: [Configure elmah.io manually](configure-elmah-io-manually.md).
