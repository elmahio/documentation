# How to create a new log

New logs can be created from the dashboard. In the left menu, click the item with the name *Dashboard* or navigate to the `/dashboard/` URL. When on the dashboard, you will see a large white button underneath your logs with the text *Create log*. Click the button and fill in the details. Finally, click the *Save* button, and you will be directed to the log settings page to configure your application to use the new log.

If you don't see a button named *Create log* on the dashboard, it means that you are missing permissions. You will need to be an organization administrator to create new logs inside the organization.
