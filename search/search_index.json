Whether it's a nice-looking SemVer string or a simple timestamp, distinguishing one version from the other is important. elmah.io supports sending version information from your application in every message logged in two ways: By adding the version manually (as explained in this document). By using the Deployment Tracking feature (as explained in Set Up Deployment Tracking ). Version Numbers on the UI Let's start by looking at how version numbers are represented in the elmah.io UI. Every message contains a version property as illustrated below: The error is logged by an application with version number 1.0.0. This way, you will be able to see which version of your software logged each message. Having the version number on the message opens up some interesting search possibilities. Imagine that you want to search for every message logged by 1.0.* versions of your software, including release candidates, etc. Simply search in the search box like this: The example above finds every message logged from 1.0.0, 1.0.0-rc1, 1.0.1, etc. Adding Version Numbers How you choose to represent version numbers in your system is really up to you. elmah.io doesn't require SemVer, even though we strongly recommend you use it. Version is a simple string in our API , which means that you can send anything from SemVer to a stringified timestamp. Adding a version number to every message logged in elmah.io is as easy as 1-2-3. If you're using our API, there's a property named version where you can put the version of your application. Chances are that you are using one of the integrations for ASP.NET Core, log4net, or Serilog. There are multiple ways to send a version number to elmah.io. ASP.NET Core Adding version information to all errors logged from Elmah.Io.AspNetCore can be achieved using the OnMessage action when initializing logging to elmah.io: builder.Services.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.OnMessage = msg => { msg.Version = \"1.2.3\"; }; }); ASP.NET You probably want to attach the same version number on every message logged in elmah.io. The easiest way to achieve that is to create a global event handler for the OnMessage event, which is triggered every time the elmah.io client logs a message to elmah.io: Elmah.ErrorLog.GetDefault(null); // Forces creation of logger client var logger = ErrorLog.Client; logger.OnMessage += (sender, args) => { args.Message.Version = \"1.2.3\"; } In the example, the message sent off to elmah.io is decorated with the version number 1.2.3 You will need to replace this with the value of an app setting, the assembly info, or whatever strategy you've used to make the version number available to your code. If you're logging errors to elmah.io in catch blocks, logging the version number can be done using a similar approach to the above: try { CallSomeBusinessLogic(inputValue); } catch (Exception e) { e.Data.Add(\"X-ELMAHIO-VERSION\", \"1.2.3\"); ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(e); } In this case, the code at this point doesn't know anything about elmah.io. Luckily, there's an alternative to the Version property, by putting a custom element in the Data dictionary on Exception. The exact name of the key must be X-ELMAHIO-VERSION for elmah.io to interpret this as the version number. Microsoft.Extensions.Logging When using the Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging package there are multiple ways of enriching log messages with version information. If you want the same version number on all log messages you can use the OnMessage action: builder.Logging.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.OnMessage = msg => { msg.Version = \"1.2.3\"; }; }); As an alternative, you can push a version property on individual log messages using either a structured property: logger.LogInformation(\"Message from {version}\", \"1.2.3\"); Or using scopes: using (logger.BeginScope(new { Version = \"1.2.3\" })) { logger.LogInformation(\"A message inside a logging scope\"); } log4net log4net supports the concept of customer properties in various ways. Since log4net properties are converted to custom properties in elmah.io, the easiest way to add a version number of every message logged through log4net is by configuring a global property somewhere in your initialization code: log4net.GlobalContext.Properties[\"version\"] = \"1.2.3\"; log4net supports custom properties in the context of a log call as well. To do that, put the version property in the ThreadContext before logging to log4net: log4net.ThreadContext.Properties[\"version\"] = \"1.2.3\"; log4net.Error(\"This is an error message\"); NLog NLog supports structured properties as well as various context objects. To set a version number on all log messages you can include the following code after initializing NLog: GlobalDiagnosticsContext.Set(\"version\", \"1.2.3\"); If the elmah.io NLog target is initialized from C# code you can also use the OnMessage action: var elmahIoTarget = new ElmahIoTarget(); // ... elmahIoTarget.OnMessage = msg => { msg.Version = \"1.2.3\"; }; To set a version number on a single log message, you can include it as a property: log.Info(\"Message from {version}\", \"1.2.3\"); Serilog Serilog can decorate all log messages using enrichers: var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .Enrich.WithProperty(\"version\", \"1.2.3\") .Enrich.FromLogContext() .WriteTo.ElmahIo(new ElmahIoSinkOptions(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"))) .CreateLogger(); You can also enrich a single log message with a version number using a structured property: Log.Information(\"Meesage from {version}\", \"1.2.3\"); Or using the LogContext : using (LogContext.PushProperty(\"version\", \"1.2.3\")) { Log.Error(\"An error message\"); }","title":"Adding version information"},{"location":"adding-version-information/#adding-version-information","text":"Adding Version Information Version Numbers on the UI Adding Version Numbers ASP.NET Core ASP.NET Microsoft.Extensions.Logging log4net NLog Serilog Almost every piece of software has some sort of version.

Applications like Microsoft Monitoring Agent (Application Insights) are known for creating problems for other software running on the same machine. Pause or stop any other monitoring service to see if the problem goes away. Exceptions aren't logged to elmah.io when adding the HandleError attribute Much like custom errors, the HandleError attribute can swallow exceptions from your website. This means that ASP.NET MVC catches any exceptions and shows the Error.cshtml view. To log exceptions with this setup, you will need to extend your Error.cshtml file: @model System.Web.Mvc.HandleErrorInfo @{ if (Model.Exception != null) { Elmah.ErrorLog.GetDefault(HttpContext.Current).Log(new Elmah.Error(Model.Exception, HttpContext.Current)); } } <div> Your error page content goes here </div> Errors are not logged when using update panels ASP.NET Update Panels are great at many things. Unfortunately, one of those things is causing problems when trying to log server-side errors. If errors aren't logged as part of a call made from an update panel, you can try to add the following code to Global.asax.cs : protected void Application_Error(object sender, EventArgs e) { var ex = Server.GetLastError(); var error = new Elmah.Error(ex); error.ServerVariables.Add(\"URL\", HttpContext.Current?.Request?.Url?.AbsolutePath); error.ServerVariables.Add(\"HTTP_USER_AGENT\", HttpContext.Current?.Request?.UserAgent); error.ServerVariables.Add(\"REMOTE_ADDR\", HttpContext.Current?.Request?.UserHostAddress); Elmah.ErrorLog.GetDefault(HttpContext.Current).Log(error); } If you start experiencing errors logged multiple times, you can remove the ELMAH module from web.config : <modules> <add name=\"ErrorLog\" type=\"Elmah.ErrorLogModule, Elmah\" preCondition=\"managedHandler\" /> </modules>","title":"ASP.NET troubleshooting"},{"location":"asp-net-troubleshooting/#aspnet-troubleshooting","text":"You are probably here because your application doesn't log errors to elmah.io, even though you installed the integration.

This guide is also available as a short video tutorial here: The rule engine is located beneath each log on the log settings page: A rule consists of three parts: a title, a query, and an action. The title should be a short text explaining what this rule does. We don't use the title for anything, so please write something that helps you identify rules and keep them apart. The query should contain either a full-text search string or a Lucene query. When new messages are logged, the message is matched up against all queries registered on that log. If and only if a message matches a query, the action registered on the rule is performed. As mentioned above, the action part of a rule is executed when a message matches the query specified in the same rule. An action can be one of six types: Ignore, Hide, Mail, HTTP Request, Mark as bot, and Mark as fixed. To illustrate how to use each action type, here are six examples of useful rules. Ignore errors with an HTTP status code of 400 Note Be aware that Ignore rules are only meant as a temporary way of ignoring messages. In case you want to permanently ignore one or more log messages, use client-side filtering as explained in the documentation for each client integration.

This guide is also available as a short video tutorial here: The rule engine is located beneath each log on the log settings page: A rule consists of three parts: a title, a query, and an action. The title should be a short text explaining what this rule does. We don't use the title for anything, so please write something that helps you identify rules and keep them apart. The query should contain either a full-text search string or a Lucene query. When new messages are logged, the message is matched up against all queries registered on that log. If and only if a message matches a query, the action registered on the rule is performed. As mentioned above, the action part of a rule is executed when a message matches the query specified in the same rule. An action can be one of six types: Ignore, Hide, Mail, HTTP Request, Mark as bot, and Mark as fixed. To illustrate how to use each action type, here are six examples of useful rules.","title":"Creating Rules to Perform Actions on Messages"},{"location":"creating-rules-to-perform-actions-on-messages/#ignore-errors-with-an-http-status-code-of-400","text":"Note Be aware that Ignore rules are only meant as a temporary way of ignoring messages.

The purpose of this article is to give a bit of background on the differences between ELMAH and elmah.io and why they share similar names. What is ELMAH? ELMAH is an error logging framework originally developed by Atif Aziz in 2004 able to log all unhandled exceptions from .NET web applications. Errors can be logged to a variety of destinations through ELMAH's plugin model called error logs. Plugins for XML, SQL Server, MySQL, Elasticsearch, and many more exist. ELMAH automatically collects a lot of information from the HTTP context when logging the error, giving you the possibility to inspect request parameters, cookies, and much more for the failed request. Custom errors can be logged to ELMAH, by manually calling the error log. What is elmah.io? elmah.io is a cloud-based error management system originally developed on top of ELMAH (see history for details). Besides supporting ELMAH, elmah.io also integrates with popular logging frameworks like log4net , NLog , Serilog , and web frameworks like ASP.NET Core . elmah.io offers a superior notification model to ELMAH, with integrations to mail, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and many others. elmah.io also built a lot of features outside the scope of ELMAH, like a complete uptime monitoring system.

We had some simple search and graphing possibilities, but the platform was meant as an alternative to host your own error logs in SQL Server or similar. In time, elmah.io grew from being a hobby project to an actual company. During those years, we realized that the potential of the platform exceeded the possibilities with ELMAH in many ways. New features not available in ELMAH have been added constantly. A process that would have been nearly impossible with ELMAH's many storage integrations.

Note The Office 365 API used behind the scenes for this app uses throttling rather than a maximum of allowed requests. This means that you may start experiencing messages not being sent, if you start logging a large amount of messages. We have experienced a lot of weird error codes when communicating with the API. An example of this is an exception while posting data to the API, but the data is successfully shown on Teams. The result of this error is, that elmah.io retries the failing request multiple times, which causes the same message to be shown multiple times on Teams.","title":"Teams v1"},{"location":"elmah-io-apps-teams/#microsoft-teams-troubleshooting","text":"Errors don't show up in Teams. Here are a few things to try out. Make sure that the Teams app is installed on the log as described above. Only new errors are sent to Teams. A new error has a severity of Error or Fatal and is marked with a yellow star on the search tab. We only send new errors to help you stay out of Teams' API limits. If sending all errors, you could quickly end up in a scenario where the same error is sent multiple times and more important errors get ignored by Teams. Re-install the app on elmah.io with the webhook URL provided by Teams. Remove the elmah.io configuration from Teams and re-install it. After re-installing the app, you will need to copy the new webhook URL provided by Teams and input it in the elmah.io Teams app as descrived above. Go to the Apps page on Teams and search for 'elmah.io'. Remove the app entirely, click F5 to refresh the page, and install the app again.

Timeout when creating heartbeats through Elmah.Io.Client If you experience a timeout when calling the Healthy , Degraded , or Unhealthy method, you may want to adjust the default HTTP timeout. Elmah.Io.Client has a default timeout of 5 seconds to make sure that logging to elmah.io from a web application won't slow down the web app too much in case of slow response time from the elmah.io API. While 99.9% of the requests to the elmah.io API finish within this timeout, problems with Azure, the network connection, and a lot of other issues can happen. Since heartbeats typically run outside the scope of a web request, it's safe to increase the default HTTP timeout in this case: var api = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\", new ElmahIoOptions { Timeout = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 30) }); The example set a timeout of 30 seconds. SocketException when creating heartbeats through Elmah.Io.Client A System.Net.Sockets.SocketException when communicating with the elmah.io API can mean multiple things. The API can be down or there's network problems between your machine and the API. Increasing the timeout as shown in the previous section should be step one.

Many other features are based on this mechanism to help you reduce the number of emails, Slack/Teams messages, and more. We often receive questions about how this works and how to tweak it. This article aims to bring some clarity to questions about this feature. When logging messages to elmah.io using either one of the integrations or through the API, we automatically set a flag named isNew on each log message. Calculating the value of this field is based on a rather complex algorithm. The implementation is closed-source but not a huge secret. Each message is assigned a hash value based on a range of fields like the message template, the severity, the URL, and more. Some values are normalized or modified before being sent as input to the hash function. An example of this is removing numbers from the log message, which will ensure that Error on product 1 and Error on product 2 will be considered the same log message. When receiving a new log message, we check if an existing message with the same hash is already stored in the log. If not, the new message will be marked as New by setting the isNew flag to true . If we already found one or more log messages with the same hash, the new message will have its isNew flag set to false . Messages and apps Most apps and features around sending messages from elmah.io are based on the isNew flag. This means that only new errors trigger the New Error Email , the Slack and Teams apps, etc. This is done to avoid flooding the recipient system with emails or messages. You typically don't want 1,000 emails if the same error occurs 1,000 times. Error occurrence is still important, why there are other features to help you deal with this like the Error Occurrence Email and spike-based machine learning features. Modifying the hash function We sometimes get requests to modify the hash function, but unfortunately, that's currently not possible. We change the implementation from time to time to improve the uniqueness detection over time. If you have an example of two log messages that should have been considered unique or not considered unique, feel free to reach out. This may or may not result in changes to the hash function. There are still some possibilities to force two log messages to not be unique. The obvious is to include different variables inside the log message. Remember that numbers are removed, why this must consist of letters. Another approach is to put individual values in the source field. This can be done in all integrations by implementing the OnMessage action. Some integrations also support setting the source field by including it as structured properties like Error from {source} . Setting recurring messages as New A common request is to get a notification if an error that you believed was fixed re-occur. This scenario is built into elmah.io's issue tracker. When marking a log message as fixed through the UI or API, elmah.io automatically marks all instances of the log message as fixed. If a new log message with the same hash is logged at some point, the isNew flag on this message will be set to true . This will trigger the New Error Email and most of the integrations again. Retention Depending on your current plan, each subscription provides x days of retention for log messages. This means that log messages are automatically deleted after x days in the database. Once all instances of a log message are deleted, a new log message generating the same hash as the deleted messages will be marked as new. To increase the chance of log messages being marked as new, you can lower the retention on each log on the Log Settings page.","title":"How does the new detection work"},{"location":"how-does-the-new-detection-work/#how-does-the-new-detection-work","text":"Being able to identify when a logged error is new or a duplicate of an already logged error is one of the most important features on elmah.io.

Some developers like to split up their code into microservices. Others have requirements for running code asynchronous behind a queue. The common theme here is that code often runs in multiple processes spread across multiple servers. While logging can be easily set up in different projects and services, being able to correlate log messages across multiple services isn't normally available when logging to individual log outputs. Imagine a console application making an HTTP request to your public API. The API calls an internal API, which again puts a message on a queue. A service consumes messages from the queue and ends up logging an error in the error log. Seeing the entire log trace from receiving the request on the API straight down the chain resulting in the error, highly increases the chance of figuring out what went wrong. With the Correlation feature on elmah.io, we want to help you achieve just that. In this article, you will learn how to set up Correlations. Note Correlation currently requires all of your applications to log to the same log on elmah.io. For you to separate log messages from each service, we recommend setting the Application property on all log messages. Filtering on log messages is available through the elmah.io UI. We may want to explore ways to use Correlation across multiple error logs in the future. CorrelationId explained The way log messages are correlated on elmah.io is based on a property on all log messages named correlationId . The field is available both when creating log messages through our API as well as in the Elmah.Io.Client NuGet package. The property is a string which means that you can use whatever schema you want for the correlation ID. To set the correlation ID using the client, use the following code: var myCorrelationId = \"42\"; var client = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\"); await client.Messages.CreateAndNotifyAsync(new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"), new CreateMessage { Title = \"Hello World\", // ... CorrelationId = myCorrelationId }); In a real-world scenario, myCorrelationId wouldn't be hardcoded but pulled from a shared header, message ID, or similar. As long as all services set CorrelationId to the same ID, log messages within a correlation can be searched on the elmah.io UI: Setting CorrelationId How you set the correlation ID depends on which integration you are using. In some cases, a correlation ID is set automatically while others will require a few lines of code. Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.Correlation We have developed a NuGet package dedicated to setting the correlation ID from the current activity in an easy way. The package can be used together with all of the various client integrations we offer (like Elmah.Io.AspNetCore and Elmah.Io.NLog ). Start by installing the package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.Correlation Install-Package Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.Correlation <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.Correlation\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.Correlation Next, call the WithCorrelationIdFromActivity method as part of the OnMessage action/event. How you do this depends on which of the client integrations you are using. For Elmah.Io.Client it can be done like this: var elmahIo = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\"); elmahIo.Messages.OnMessage += (sender, args) => { args.Message.WithCorrelationIdFromActivity(); }; For Elmah.Io.AspNetCore it can be done like this: builder.Services.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.OnMessage = msg => { msg.WithCorrelationIdFromActivity(); }; }); ASP.NET Core When logging uncaught errors using the Elmah.Io.AspNetCore package, we automatically pick up any traceparent header and put the trace ID as part of the error logged to elmah.io. For an overview of wrapping calls to your ASP.NET Core API in an Activity check out the section about W3C Trace Context. If you want to set the correlation ID manually, you can use the OnMessage action: builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoOptions>(o => { o.OnMessage = msg => { msg.CorrelationId = \"42\"; }; }); When requested through the browser, a traceparent is not automatically added, unless you manually do so by using an extension as shown in the W3C section. In this case, you can either install the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.Correlation package as already explained, or set the correlationId manually by installing the System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource NuGet package and adding the following code to the OnMessage action: o.OnMessage = msg => { msg.CorrelationId = System.Diagnostics.Activity.Current?.TraceId.ToString(); }; Microsoft.Extensions.Logging To store a correlation ID when logging through Microsoft.Extensions.Logging you can either set the CorrelationId property (manually or using the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.Correlation NuGet package) or rely on the automatic behavior built into Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. To manually set the correlation you can include correlationId as part of the log message: logger.LogInformation(\"A log message with {correlationId}\", \"42\"); Or you can put the correlation ID as part of a logging scope: using (logger.BeginScope(new { CorrelationId = \"42\" })) { logger.LogInformation(\"A log message\"); } In some cases, a correlation ID will be set automatically. If there is a current active Activity (see later), Microsoft.Extensions.Logging automatically decorates all log messages with a custom property named TraceId . The elmah.io backend will pick up any value in the TraceId and use that as the correlation ID. Serilog When logging through Serilog a correlation ID can be added to one or more log messages in multiple ways. The most obvious being on the log message itself: Log.Information(\"A log message with {correlationId}\", \"42\"); If you don't want correlation ID as part of the log message, you can push the property using LogContext : using (LogContext.PushProperty(\"correlationId\", \"42\")) { Log.Information(\"A log message\"); } You will need to install the LogContext enricher for this to work: Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .Enrich.FromLogContext() // ... .CreateLogger(); The elmah.io sink for Serilog is an async batching sync. This means that log messages are not logged in the same millisecond as one of the logging methods on the Log class is called and the current activity is no longer set. When logging from a web application or other project types where the activity is short-lived, you either need to include the correlation ID as part of the message (as shown in the previous examples) or you need to store the correlation ID as part of the request. For ASP.NET Core this can be done using middleware: app.Use(async (ctx, next) => { IDisposable disposeMe = null; var activity = Activity.Current; if (activity != null) { disposeMe = LogContext.PushProperty(\"correlationid\", activity.TraceId.ToString()); } try { await next(); } finally { disposeMe?.Dispose(); } }); All calls to Serilog within the web request will have the correlation ID set to the TraceId of the current activity. Other frameworks support similar features for enriching the current request or invocation with custom properties. NLog Correlation ID can be set on log messages logged through NLog in multiple ways. The first approach is to include the ID directly in the log message: logger.Info(\"A log message with {correlationId}\", \"42\"); If you don't want the ID as part of the log message you can use either NLog's two context objects: using (MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext.SetScoped(\"correlationId\", \"42\")) { logger.Info(\"A log message\"); } GlobalDiagnosticsContext.Set(\"correlationId\", \"42\"); You can also add the property manually to the log message using the log event builder API available in NLog: var infoMessage = new LogEventInfo(LogLevel.Info, \"\", \"A log message\"); infoMessage.Properties.Add(\"correlationid\", \"42\"); logger.Info(infoMessage); log4net Correlation ID can be set on log messages logged through log4net in multiple ways. You can include it directly on the LoggingEvent : var properties = new PropertiesDictionary(); properties[\"correlationid\"] = \"42\"; log.Logger.Log(new LoggingEvent(new LoggingEventData { Level = Level.Info, TimeStampUtc = DateTime.UtcNow, Properties = properties, Message = \"A log message\", })); You most likely use the Info , Warn , and similar helper methods to store log messages. In this case, you can set the correlation ID on the ThreadContext : ThreadContext.Properties[\"correlationid\"] = \"42\"; log.Info(\"A log message\"); Please notice that correlationid in both examples must be in all lowercase. Durable Azure Functions Both the in-process and out-of-process (Isolated) models for developing Azure Functions come with the option of Durable Functions. By default, each activity function (functions initiated by the orchestrator) starts its own Activity meaning that log messages sent across multiple functions will not be correlated. To make this work, Durable Functions support Distributed Tracing , which can be enabled in the host.json file: { \"extensions\": { \"durableTask\": { \"tracing\": { \"distributedTracingEnabled\": true, \"version\": \"V2\" } } } } Once enabled, you will need to install the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.Correlation NuGet package and call WithCorrelationIdFromActivity as shown previously: app.Services.AddLogging(logging => { logging.AddElmahIo(o => { // ... o.OnMessage = msg => { msg.WithCorrelationIdFromActivity(); }; }); }); Please note that when enabling Distributed Tracing without having configured Application Insights, the functions runtime will show a warning when launching the function app. We are trying to convince Microsoft to either remove this or change it to an information message, since Distributed Tracing doesn't require Application Insights. W3C Trace Context The class Activity has been mentioned a couple of times already. Let's take a look at what that is and how it relates to W3C Trace Context. Trace Context is a specification by W3C for implementing distributed tracing across multiple processes which are already widely adopted. If you generate a trace identifier in a client initiating a chain of events, different Microsoft technologies like ASP.NET Core already pick up the extended set of headers and include those as part of log messages logged through Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. Let's say we have a console application calling an API and we want to log messages in both the console app and in the API and correlate them in elmah.io. In both the console app and in the ASP.NET Core application, you would set up Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging using the default configuration. Then in the console application, you will wrap the call to the API in an Activity : var httpClient = new HttpClient(); var activity = new Activity(\"ApiCall\").Start(); try { using (logger.BeginScope(new { TraceId = activity.TraceId, ParentId = activity.ParentSpanId, SpanId = activity.SpanId })) { logger.LogInformation(\"Fetching data from the API\"); var result = await httpClient.GetStreamAsync(\"https://localhost:44396/ping\"); // ... } } finally { activity.Stop(); } By creating and starting a new Activity before we call the API, log messages in the console app can be decorated with three additional properties: TraceId , ParentId , and SpanId . This will make sure that all log messages logged within this scope will get the correlation ID set on elmah.io. HttpClient automatically picks up the activity and decorates the request with additional headers. On the API we simply log as normal: [ApiController] [Route(\"[controller]\")] public class PingController : ControllerBase { private readonly ILogger<PingController> _logger; public PingController(ILogger<PingController> logger) { _logger = logger; } [HttpGet] public string Get() { _logger.LogInformation(\"Received a ping\"); return \"pong\"; } } Notice that we didn't have to decorate log messages with additional properties. ASP.NET Core automatically picks up the new headers and decorates all log messages with the correct trace ID. If you want to test this through a browser, you'll need to modify the request headers before the request is made to your web application. There is a range of extensions available to help with this. For the following example, we'll use ModHeader : The extension will enrich all requests with a header named traceparent in the format VERSION-TRACE_ID-SPAN_ID-TRACE_FLAGS . elmah.io will automatically pick up this header and set correlationId to the value of TRACE_ID . If you don't get a correlation ID set on your log messages, we recommend installing the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.Correlation NuGet package and calling the following method in the OnMessage event/action: msg.WithCorrelationIdFromActivity();","title":"How to correlate messages across services"},{"location":"how-to-correlate-messages-across-services/#how-to-correlate-messages-across-services","text":"How to correlate messages across services CorrelationId explained Setting CorrelationId Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.Correlation ASP.NET Core Microsoft.Extensions.Logging Serilog NLog log4net Durable Azure Functions W3C Trace Context A common architecture is to spread out code across multiple services. Some developers like to split up their code into microservices. Others have requirements for running code asynchronous behind a queue. The common theme here is that code often runs in multiple processes spread across multiple servers. While logging can be easily set up in different projects and services, being able to correlate log messages across multiple services isn't normally available when logging to individual log outputs. Imagine a console application making an HTTP request to your public API. The API calls an internal API, which again puts a message on a queue. A service consumes messages from the queue and ends up logging an error in the error log. Seeing the entire log trace from receiving the request on the API straight down the chain resulting in the error, highly increases the chance of figuring out what went wrong. With the Correlation feature on elmah.io, we want to help you achieve just that. In this article, you will learn how to set up Correlations. Note Correlation currently requires all of your applications to log to the same log on elmah.io. For you to separate log messages from each service, we recommend setting the Application property on all log messages. Filtering on log messages is available through the elmah.io UI. We may want to explore ways to use Correlation across multiple error logs in the future.","title":"How to correlate messages across services"},{"location":"how-to-correlate-messages-across-services/#correlationid-explained","text":"The way log messages are correlated on elmah.io is based on a property on all log messages named correlationId .

To set the correlation ID using the client, use the following code: var myCorrelationId = \"42\"; var client = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\"); await client.Messages.CreateAndNotifyAsync(new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"), new CreateMessage { Title = \"Hello World\", // ... CorrelationId = myCorrelationId }); In a real-world scenario, myCorrelationId wouldn't be hardcoded but pulled from a shared header, message ID, or similar.

In this document, you will find help getting the right client IP into elmah.io. Missing IP when using a proxy If you are using a proxy layer in between the client and your web server, you may experience log messages without a client IP. This is probably caused by the proxy hiding the original IP from your web server. Most proxies offer an alternative server variable like the X-Forwarded-For header. You can inspect the server variables on the Server Variables tab on elmah.io and check if your proxy includes the original IP in any of the variables. We support custom headers from a range of proxies (like Cloudflare). Most proxies support some kind of settings area where the X-Forwarded-For header can be enabled. If you are using a proxy that uses custom headers, please make sure to reach out and we may want to include the custom header to elmah.io. Wrong IP when using a proxy If the client IP is wrong when behind a proxy, it is typically because the proxy replaces the client IP when calling your server with the IP of its server.

This can help debug exceptions thrown while executing SQL code against a relational database. To make the SQL tab show up, custom information needs to be included in the Data dictionary of a log message. The following sections will go into detail on how to include the custom information in various ways. Entity Framework Core Entity Framework Core is easy since it already includes any SQL code as part of the messages logged through Microsoft.Extensions.Logging's ILogger . The SQL code and parameters are logged as two properties named commandText and parameters . elmah.io will automatically pick up these properties and show the SQL tab with the formatted results. As a default, all values in parameters are not logged as part of the message. You will see this from values being set to ? in the UI.

If you often find yourself opening Visual Studio or Code to inspect the failing line, embedding source code in errors and log messages will speed up the process. In this article, you will learn how to configure elmah.io to include source code when logging messages using the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode NuGet package. Note The Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode package requires Elmah.Io.Client version 4.0 or newer. No matter what integration you are using (with a few exceptions) you are using the Elmah.Io.Client NuGet package to communicate with the elmah.io API. We have built a range of extensions for this package, to avoid including too many features not related to communicating with the API into the client package. One of them is for including source code when logging messages. Start by installing the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode Install-Package Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode There are currently three ways of including source code with log messages. The first two ways require the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode package, while the third one can be done manually. From the file system This is the most simple approach meant for local development. When logging a stack trace from your local machine, the trace includes the absolute path to the file on your file system, as well as the line causing a log message (typically an error). To set this up, you will need to implement the OnMessage event through the Elmah.Io.Client package. Depending on which integration you are using, the name of that event or action can vary. What you are looking to do is to call the WithSourceCodeFromFileSystem method on log messages you want to include source code. This is an example when using the Elmah.Io.Client directly: var elmahIoClient = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\"); elmahIoClient.Messages.OnMessage += (sender, e) => e.Message.WithSourceCodeFromFileSystem(); Using an integration like Elmah.Io.AspNetCore uses the same method: services.AddElmahIo(options => { options.OnMessage = msg => msg.WithSourceCodeFromFileSystem(); }); This will automatically instruct Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.Source to try and parse any stack trace in the details property and embed the source code. For an example of how to use the WithSourceCodeFromFileSystem method, check out the following sample: Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode.FileSystem . From the PDB file When deploying your code on another environment, you typically don't have the original code available. If you copy your source code to the same absolute path as when building, you can use the file-system approach shown above. If not, embedding the source code in the PDB file can be the option. Before doing so, make sure you include filename and line numbers in stack traces on all environments as shown here: Include filename and line number in stack traces . For the old project template the Debugging information field needs a value of Portable . For the new project template the Debug symbols field needs a value of PDB file, portable across platforms . To embed source code in the PDB file built alongside your DLL files, include the following property in your csproj file: <PropertyGroup> <EmbedAllSources>true</EmbedAllSources> </PropertyGroup> Be aware that this will include your original source code in your deployment which may not be a good approach if other people have access to the environment or binary files. Next, call the WithSourceCodeFromPdb method: var elmahIoClient = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\"); elmahIoClient.Messages.OnMessage += (sender, e) => e.Message.WithSourceCodeFromPdb(); For an example of how to do this from ASP.NET Core, you can use the same approach as specified in the previous section: services.AddElmahIo(options => { options.OnMessage = msg => msg.WithSourceCodeFromPdb(); }); All of our integrations support a message callback somehow. For an example of how to use the WithSourceCodeFromPdb method, check out the following sample: Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode.PdbSample for .NET and Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode.NetFrameworkPdb for .NET Framework. Manually In case you want to include source code manually, you can use the OnMessage event and the Code property on the CreateMessage class: var elmahIoClient = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\"); elmahIoClient.Messages.OnMessage += (sender, e) => { e.Message.Code = FetchCode(); } You will need to implement the FetchCode method to return the source code to include. Only 21 lines of code are supported for now. In case you want elmah.io to show the correct line numbers, you will need to tell us how the first line number in the provided code matches your original source file as well as the line number causing the error. This is done by adding two Item s to the Data dictionary on CreateMessage : var elmahIoClient = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\"); elmahIoClient.Messages.OnMessage += (sender, e) => { e.Message.Code = FetchCode(); if (e.Message.Data == null) e.Message.Data = new List<Item>(); e.Message.Data.Add(new Item(\"X-ELMAHIO-CODESTARTLINE\", \"42\")); e.Message.Data.Add(new Item(\"X-ELMAHIO-CODELINE\", \"51\")); } This will show line number 42 next to the first code line and highlight line number 51 in the elmah.io UI. Include source code Troubleshooting If no source code shows up on elmah.io log messages, you can start by running through the following checks: Make sure that the log message contains a stack trace in the details field. Make sure that the stack trace contains absolute path filenames and line numbers for the code causing the stack trace. Make sure that you are calling the WithSourceCodeFromPdb or WithSourceCodeFromFileSystem method. Make sure that the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode.dll file is in your deployed application. Make sure that your project has Portable set in Debugging information or PDB File, portable across platforms set in Debug symbols .

When deploying your application to the test and production environment, you normally want to use the Release configuration. When doing so, your code is optimized, web.config transformation is running, and a few additional things. But, part of running on a Release build is, that you lose the ability to see filenames and line numbers in the stack traces produced by your system. .NET offers the concept of PDB files, which are automatically generated when building your code. The PDB file contains information for the debugger to work, like which file to look up when a breakpoint is reached in your code. Unless you have changed the default settings inside Visual Studio, both the Debug and Release configuration generates a PDB file. So, if both Debug and Release produce a PDB file, why do Debug builds include file name and line number in stack traces, while the Release build doesn't? The reason is most often caused by the fact that PDB files aren't published as part of the deployment. To do so, right-click your project in Visual Studio and select Properties .

Next, remove the checkmark in Exclude generated debug symbols : Also, make sure that the PDB file is generated as part of Release builds. Select the Build tab and click Advanced... .

Note Depending on who you talk to, deploying PDB files as part of your build may be considered a hack. Since PDB files can contain sensitive information about your implementation, publishing these files should only be done, if you have full control of the environment you are deploying to. When releasing software to external users/customers, you don't want to include your PDB files.

Breadcrumbs with elmah.io and ASP.NET Core are supported in two ways: manual and through Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. Manually logging breadcrumbs If you want to log a breadcrumb manually as part of an MVC controller action or similar, you can use the ElmahIoApi class: ElmahIoApi.AddBreadcrumb( new Breadcrumb(DateTime.UtcNow, message: \"Requesting the front page\"), HttpContext); Notice that the Breadcrumb class is located in the Elmah.Io.Client package that will be automatically installed when installing Elmah.Io.AspNetCore . The Breadcrumb class is either in the Elmah.Io.Client or Elmah.Io.Client.Models namespace, depending on which version of Elmah.Io.Client you have installed. The best example of a helpful breadcrumb is logging the input model to all endpoints as a breadcrumb. This will show you exactly which parameters the user sends to your website.

For web APIs implemented with Azure Functions, you should create a /health endpoint and ping that using Uptime Monitoring . But for timer triggered, queue triggers, and similar function apps, heartbeats are a great way to verify that your function is successfully running. The rest of this document is split into different ways of adding heartbeats to one or more functions. Using a filter in Elmah.Io.Functions The easiest way of including a heartbeat is to include the ElmahIoHeartbeatFilter available in the Elmah.Io.Functions package. This will automatically publish a Healthy or Unhealthy heartbeat, depending on if your functions execute successfully. This option is great for timer-triggered functions like nightly batch jobs. Start by installing the Elmah.Io.Functions package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Functions Install-Package Elmah.Io.Functions <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Functions\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Functions Elmah.Io.Functions requires dependency injection part of the Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions package, why you will need this package if not already added. Extend the Startup.cs (or whatever you named your function startup class) file with the following code: using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions.DependencyInjection; using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host; using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration; using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection; using Elmah.Io.Functions; [assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(My.FunctionApp.Startup))] namespace My.FunctionApp { public class Startup : FunctionsStartup { public override void Configure(IFunctionsHostBuilder builder) { var config = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"local.settings.json\", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true) .AddEnvironmentVariables() .Build(); builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoFunctionOptions>(o => { o.ApiKey = config[\"apiKey\"]; o.LogId = new Guid(config[\"logId\"]); o.HeartbeatId = config[\"heartbeatId\"]; }); builder.Services.AddSingleton<IFunctionFilter, ElmahIoHeartbeatFilter>(); } } } The code installs the ElmahIoHeartbeatFilter class, which will handle all of the communication with the elmah.io API. Finally, add the config variables ( apiKey , logId , and heartbeatId ) to the local.settings.json file, environment variables, Azure configuration settings, or in whatever way you specify settings for your function app. Manually using Elmah.Io.Client The example above installs the heartbeat filter for all functions. If you have multiple functions inside your function app, or you want greater control of when and how to send heartbeats, you can use Elmah.Io.Client to create heartbeats. Start by installing the Elmah.Io.Client NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Client Install-Package Elmah.Io.Client <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Client\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Client Extend the Startup.cs file with the following code: using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions.DependencyInjection; using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host; using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration; using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection; using Elmah.Io.Client; [assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(My.FunctionApp.Startup))] namespace My.FunctionApp { public class Startup : FunctionsStartup { public override void Configure(IFunctionsHostBuilder builder) { var config = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"local.settings.json\", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true) .AddEnvironmentVariables() .Build(); builder.Services.AddSingleton(config); var elmahIo = ElmahioAPI.Create(config[\"apiKey\"]); builder.Services.AddSingleton(elmahIo.Heartbeats); } } } Inside your function, wrap all of the code in try/catch and add code to create either a Healthy or Unhealthy heartbeat: using System; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Elmah.Io.Client; using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs; using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration; namespace My.FunctionApp { public class TimedFunction { private readonly IHeartbeats heartbeats; private readonly IConfiguration configuration; public TimedFunction(IHeartbeats heartbeats, IConfiguration configuration) { this.heartbeats = heartbeats; this.configuration = configuration; } [FunctionName(\"TimedFunction\")] public async Task Run([TimerTrigger(\"0 0 * * * *\")]TimerInfo myTimer) { var heartbeatId = configuration[\"heartbeatId\"]; var logId = configuration[\"logId\"]; try { // Your function code goes here await heartbeats.CreateAsync(heartbeatId, logId, new CreateHeartbeat { Result = \"Healthy\" }); } catch (Exception e) { await heartbeats.CreateAsync(heartbeatId, logId, new CreateHeartbeat { Result = \"Unhealthy\", Reason = e.ToString(), }); } } } } If your function code executes successfully, a Healthy heartbeat is created. If an exception is thrown, an Unhealthy heartbeat with the thrown exception in Reason is created. Be aware that configuring a function to run in an internal (like every hour for the example above) does not ensure that the function is executed exactly on the hour. We recommend to set the grace period for these types of heartbeats to 15-30 minutes to avoid heartbeat errors when the timed function is past due. Using a separate heartbeat function You may want a single heartbeat representing your entire function app consisting of multiple functions. This is a good option if you want to create heartbeats from queue-triggered functions or similar. In these cases, you don't want to create a heartbeat every time a message from the queue is handled, but you will want to notify elmah.io if dependencies like database connection suddenly aren't available. We recommend creating a new heartbeat function for this kind of Function. Like in the previous example, make sure to extend your Startup.cs file like this: using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions.DependencyInjection; using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host; using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration; using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection; using Elmah.Io.Client; [assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(My.FunctionApp.Startup))] namespace My.FunctionApp { public class Startup : FunctionsStartup { public override void Configure(IFunctionsHostBuilder builder) { var config = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"local.settings.json\", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true) .AddEnvironmentVariables() .Build(); builder.Services.AddSingleton(config); var elmahIo = ElmahioAPI.Create(config[\"apiKey\"]); builder.Services.AddSingleton(elmahIo.Heartbeats); } } } Then create a new timed function with the following code: using System; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Elmah.Io.Client; using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs; using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration; namespace My.FunctionApp { public class Heartbeat { private readonly IConfiguration config; private readonly IHeartbeats heartbeats; public Heartbeat(IHeartbeats heartbeats, IConfiguration config) { this.heartbeats = heartbeats; this.config = config; } [FunctionName(\"Heartbeat\")] public async Task Run([TimerTrigger(\"0 */5 * * * *\")]TimerInfo myTimer) { var result = \"Healthy\"; var reason = (string)null; try { // Check your dependencies here } catch (Exception e) { result = \"Unhealthy\"; reason = e.ToString(); } await heartbeats.CreateAsync(config[\"heartbeatId\"], config[\"logId\"], new CreateHeartbeat { Result = result, Reason = reason, }); } } } In the example above, the new function named Heartbeat (the name is entirely up to you) executes every 5 minutes. Replace the comment with your checks like opening a connection to the database. If everything works as it should, a Healthy heartbeat is logged to elmah.io. If an exception is thrown while checking your dependencies, an Unhealthy heartbeat is created. When running locally, you may want to disable heartbeats.

To use AppSettingsElmahIoHeartbeatAttribute simply add it to the method: [AppSettingsElmahIoHeartbeat] public void Test() { // ... } As an alternative, you can register the ElmahIoHeartbeatAttribute as a global attribute. In this example we use IConfiguration in ASP.NET Core to fetch configuration from the appsettings.json file: public class Startup { public Startup(IConfiguration configuration) { Configuration = configuration; } public IConfiguration Configuration { get; } // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container. public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { services.AddHangfire(config => config // ... .UseFilter(new ElmahIoHeartbeatAttribute( Configuration[\"ElmahIo:ApiKey\"], Configuration[\"ElmahIo:LogId\"], Configuration[\"ElmahIo:HeartbeatId\"]))); } // ... } This will execute the ElmahIoHeartbeat filter for every Hangfire job which isn't ideal if running multiple jobs within the same project.","title":"Move configuration to config files"},{"location":"logging-heartbeats-from-isolated-azure-functions/","text":"Logging heartbeats from Isolated Azure Functions Logging heartbeats from Isolated Azure Functions Using middleware in Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated Manually using Elmah.Io.Client Using a separate heartbeat function Isolated Azure Functions are great candidates for adding heartbeats. For web APIs implemented with Isolated Azure Functions, you should create a /health endpoint and ping that using Uptime Monitoring . But for timer triggered, queue triggers, and similar function apps, heartbeats are a great way to verify that your function is successfully running. The rest of this document is split into different ways of adding heartbeats to one or more functions. Using middleware in Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated Scheduled functions or functions not running often can use the heartbeat middleware part of the Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated package. This will log a Healthy or Unhealthy endpoint every time a function is running. All functions within the same function app uses the same middleware, why this is primarily inteded for function apps with one scheduled function. Start by installing the Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated Install-Package Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated Extend the Program.cs file with the following code: .ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults((context, app) => { app.AddHeartbeat(options => { options.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; options.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); options.HeartbeatId = \"HEARTBEAT_ID\"; }); }) The code installs the heartbeat middleware, which will handle all of the communication with the elmah.io API. Manually using Elmah.Io.Client The example above installs the heartbeat filter for all functions. If you have multiple functions inside your function app, or you want greater control of when and how to send heartbeats, you can use Elmah.Io.Client to create heartbeats. Start by installing the Elmah.Io.Client NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Client Install-Package Elmah.Io.Client <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Client\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Client Extend the Program.cs file with the following code: .ConfigureServices((ctx, services) => { var elmahIo = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\"); services.AddSingleton(elmahIo.Heartbeats); }); Inside your function, wrap all of the code in try/catch and add code to create either a Healthy or Unhealthy heartbeat: public class TimedFunction { private readonly IHeartbeats heartbeats; private readonly IConfiguration configuration; public TimedFunction(IHeartbeats heartbeats, IConfiguration configuration) { this.heartbeats = heartbeats; this.configuration = configuration; } [FunctionName(\"TimedFunction\")] public async Task Run([TimerTrigger(\"0 0 * * * *\")]TimerInfo myTimer) { var heartbeatId = configuration[\"heartbeatId\"]; var logId = configuration[\"logId\"]; try { // Your function code goes here await heartbeats.CreateAsync(heartbeatId, logId, new CreateHeartbeat { Result = \"Healthy\" }); } catch (Exception e) { await heartbeats.CreateAsync(heartbeatId, logId, new CreateHeartbeat { Result = \"Unhealthy\", Reason = e.ToString(), }); } } } If your function code executes successfully, a Healthy heartbeat is created. If an exception is thrown, an Unhealthy heartbeat with the thrown exception in Reason is created. Be aware that configuring a function to run in an internal (like every hour for the example above) does not ensure that the function is executed exactly on the hour. We recommend to set the grace period for these types of heartbeats to 15-30 minutes to avoid heartbeat errors when the timed function is past due. Using a separate heartbeat function You may want a single heartbeat representing your entire function app consisting of multiple functions. This is a good option if you want to create heartbeats from queue-triggered functions or similar. In these cases, you don't want to create a heartbeat every time a message from the queue is handled, but you will want to notify elmah.io if dependencies like database connection suddenly aren't available. We recommend creating a new heartbeat function for this kind of Function. Like in the previous example, make sure to extend your Program.cs file like this: .ConfigureServices((ctx, services) => { var elmahIo = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\"); services.AddSingleton(elmahIo.Heartbeats); }); Then create a new timed function with the following code: using System; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Elmah.Io.Client; using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs; using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration; namespace My.FunctionApp { public class Heartbeat { private readonly IConfiguration config; private readonly IHeartbeats heartbeats; public Heartbeat(IHeartbeats heartbeats, IConfiguration config) { this.heartbeats = heartbeats; this.config = config; } [FunctionName(\"Heartbeat\")] public async Task Run([TimerTrigger(\"0 */5 * * * *\")]TimerInfo myTimer) { var result = \"Healthy\"; var reason = (string)null; try { // Check your dependencies here } catch (Exception e) { result = \"Unhealthy\"; reason = e.ToString(); } await heartbeats.CreateAsync(config[\"heartbeatId\"], config[\"logId\"], new CreateHeartbeat { Result = result, Reason = reason, }); } } } In the example above, the new function named Heartbeat (the name is entirely up to you) executes every 5 minutes.

Examples of this could be custom tools you install as Scheduled Tasks using schtasks.exe or tasks automatically registered when installing third-party software on your server. When configuring a heartbeat through the elmah.io UI you set an expected interval and grace period. If a heartbeat is not received in time, we will automatically log a missing heartbeat error. This will indicate that the scheduled task didn't run or fail and is something that should be looked at. In case you want to log a failing heartbeat as soon as the scheduled task is failing, you can do that using events logged to the Windows Event Log.

Click the OK button. In the New Trigger window click the OK button to save the trigger. Select the Actions tab. Click the New... button. Select the Start a program option in the Action dropdown. Input values like shown here: Click the OK button to save the action. Click the OK button to save the task. The final step is to add the c:\\scripts\\heartbeat.ps1 PowerShell script invoked by the task. For a better understanding of storing heartbeats through PowerShell check out Logging heartbeats from PowerShell . To log a failing heartbeat to elmah.io you can use the following PowerShell code: $apiKey = \"API_KEY\" $logId = \"LOG_ID\" $heartbeatId = \"HEARTBEAT_ID\" $url = \"https://api.elmah.io/v3/heartbeats/$logId/$heartbeatId/?api_key=$apiKey\" $body = @{ result = \"Unhealthy\" reason = \"Error in scheduled task\" } Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $url -Body ($body|ConvertTo-Json) -ContentType \"application/json-patch+json\" That's it. The new task just created will trigger every time there's an application error from your application. Notice that in case your application is manually logging errors to the event log, this will also trigger the task.

This also impacts the elmah.io client, which requires access to the URL https://api.elmah.io.

For help setting up general .NET Core logging similar to log4net, check out Logging from Microsoft.Extensions.Logging . To log all warnings and errors from ASP.NET Core, install the following NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.AspNetCore Install-Package Elmah.Io.AspNetCore <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.AspNetCore\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.AspNetCore In the Startup.cs file, add a new using statement: using Elmah.Io.AspNetCore; Standard Top-level statements Call AddElmahIo in the ConfigureServices -method: public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { services.AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; options.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); }); // ... } Replace API_KEY with your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID ( Where is my log ID? ) with the log Id of the log you want to log to. Call UseElmahIo in the Configure -method: public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory fac) { // ... app.UseElmahIo(); // ... } Call AddElmahIo in the Program.cs file: builder.Services.AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; options.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); }); Replace API_KEY with your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID ( Where is my log ID? ) with the log Id of the log you want to log to. Call UseElmahIo in the Program.cs file: app.UseElmahIo(); Note Make sure to call the UseElmahIo -method after installation of other pieces of middleware handling exceptions and auth (like UseDeveloperExceptionPage , UseExceptionHandler , UseAuthentication , and UseAuthorization ), but before any calls to UseEndpoints , UseMvc , MapRazorPages , and similar. That's it. Every uncaught exception will be logged to elmah.io. For an example of configuring elmah.io with ASP.NET Core minimal APIs, check out this sample . Configuring API key and log ID in options If you have different environments (everyone has a least localhost and production), you should consider adding the API key and log ID in your appsettings.json file: { // ... \"ElmahIo\": { \"ApiKey\": \"API_KEY\", \"LogId\": \"LOG_ID\" } } Configuring elmah.io is done by calling the Configure -method before AddElmahIo : Standard Top-level statements public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { services.Configure<ElmahIoOptions>(Configuration.GetSection(\"ElmahIo\")); services.AddElmahIo(); } Notice that you still need to call AddElmahIo to correctly register middleware dependencies. Finally, call the UseElmahIo -method (as you would do with config in C# too): public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env) { // ... app.UseElmahIo(); // ... } You can still configure additional options on the ElmahIoOptions object: public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { services.Configure<ElmahIoOptions>(Configuration.GetSection(\"ElmahIo\")); services.Configure<ElmahIoOptions>(options => { options.OnMessage = msg => { msg.Version = \"1.0.0\"; }; }); services.AddElmahIo(); } builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoOptions>(builder.Configuration.GetSection(\"ElmahIo\")); builder.Services.AddElmahIo(); Notice that you still need to call AddElmahIo to correctly register middleware dependencies. Finally, call the UseElmahIo -method (as you would do with config in C# too): app.UseElmahIo(); You can still configure additional options on the ElmahIoOptions object: builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoOptions>(builder.Configuration.GetSection(\"ElmahIo\")); builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoOptions>(o => { o.OnMessage = msg => { msg.Version = \"1.0.0\"; }; }); builder.Services.AddElmahIo(); Logging exceptions manually While automatically logging all uncaught exceptions is definitely a nice feature, sometimes you may want to catch exceptions and log them manually. If you just want to log the exception details, without all of the contextual information about the HTTP context (cookies, server variables, etc.), we recommend you to look at our integration for Microsoft.Extensions.Logging . If the context is important for the error, you can utilize the Ship -methods available in Elmah.Io.AspNetCore : try { var i = 0; var result = 42/i; } catch (DivideByZeroException e) { e.Ship(HttpContext); } When catching an exception (in this example an DivideByZeroException ), you call the Ship extension method with the current HTTP context as parameter. From Elmah.Io.AspNetCore version 3.12.* or newer, you can log manually using the ElmahIoApi class as well: ElmahIoApi.Log(e, HttpContext); The Ship -method uses ElmahIoApi underneath why both methods will give the same end result. Breadcrumbs See Logging breadcrumbs from ASP.NET Core . Additional options Setting application name If logging to the same log from multiple web apps it is a good idea to set unique application names from each app. This will let you search and filter errors on the elmah.io UI. To set an application name, add the following code to the options: builder.Services.AddElmahIo(o => { // ... o.Application = \"MyApp\"; }); The application name can also be configured through appsettings.json : { // ... \"ElmahIo\": { // ... \"Application\": \"MyApp\" } } Hooks elmah.io for ASP.NET Core supports a range of actions for hooking into the process of logging messages. Hooks are registered as actions when installing the elmah.io middleware: builder.Services.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.OnMessage = message => { message.Version = \"42\"; }; options.OnError = (message, exception) => { logger.LogError(1, exception, \"Error during log to elmah.io\"); }; }); The actions provide a mechanism for hooking into the log process. The action registered in the OnMessage property is called by elmah.io just before logging a new message to the API. Use this action to decorate/enrich your log messages with additional data, like a version number. The OnError action is called if communication with the elmah.io API failed. If this happens, you should log the message to a local log (through Microsoft.Extensions.Logging, Serilog or similar). Warning Do not log to elmah.io in your OnError action, since that could cause an infinite loop in your code. While elmah.io supports ignore rules serverside, you may want to filter out errors without even hitting the elmah.io API. Using the OnFilter function on the options object, filtering is easy: builder.Services.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.OnFilter = message => { return message.Type == \"System.NullReferenceException\"; }; }); The example above, ignores all messages of type System.NullReferenceException . Decorate from HTTP context When implementing the OnMessage action as shown above you don't have access to the current HTTP context. Elmah.Io.AspNetCore already tries to fill in as many fields as possible from the current context, but you may want to tweak something from time to time. In this case, you can implement a custom decorator like this: public class DecorateElmahIoMessages : IConfigureOptions<ElmahIoOptions> { private readonly IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor; public DecorateElmahIoMessages(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor) { this.httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor; } public void Configure(ElmahIoOptions options) { options.OnMessage = msg => { var context = httpContextAccessor.HttpContext; msg.User = context?.User?.Identity?.Name; }; } } Standard Top-level statements Then register IHttpContextAccessor and the new class in the ConfigureServices method in the Startup.cs file: public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { services.AddHttpContextAccessor(); services.AddSingleton<IConfigureOptions<ElmahIoOptions>, DecorateElmahIoMessages>(); // ... } Then register IHttpContextAccessor and the new class in the in the Program.cs file: builder.Services.AddHttpContextAccessor(); builder.Services.AddSingleton<IConfigureOptions<ElmahIoOptions>, DecorateElmahIoMessages>(); Note Decorating messages using IConfigureOptions requires Elmah.Io.AspNetCore version 4.1.37 or newer. Include source code You can use the OnMessage action to include source code to log messages. This will require a stack trace in the Detail property with filenames and line numbers in it. There are multiple ways of including source code to log messages. In short, you will need to install the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode NuGet package and call the WithSourceCodeFromPdb method in the OnMessage action: builder.Services.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.OnMessage = msg => { msg.WithSourceCodeFromPdb(); }; }); Check out How to include source code in log messages for additional requirements to make source code show up on elmah.io. Note Including source code on log messages is available in the Elmah.Io.Client v4 package and forward. Remove sensitive form data The OnMessage event can be used to filter sensitive form data as well. In the following example, we remove the server variable named Secret-Key from all messages, before sending them to elmah.io. builder.Services.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.OnMessage = msg => { var item = msg.ServerVariables.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Key == \"Secret-Key\"); if (item != null) { msg.ServerVariables.Remove(item); } }; }); Formatting exceptions A default exception formatter is used to format any exceptions, before sending them off to the elmah.io API. To override the format of the details field in elmah.io, set a new IExceptionFormatter in the ExceptionFormatter property on the ElmahIoOptions object: builder.Services.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.ExceptionFormatter = new DefaultExceptionFormatter(); } Besides the default exception formatted ( DefaultExceptionFormatter ), Elmah.Io.AspNetCore comes with a formatter called YellowScreenOfDeathExceptionFormatter . This formatter, outputs an exception and its inner exceptions as a list of exceptions, much like on the ASP.NET yellow screen of death. If you want, implementing your own exception formatter, requires you to implement a single method. Logging responses not throwing an exception As default, uncaught exceptions (500's) and 404's are logged automatically. Let's say you have a controller returning a Bad Request and want to log that as well. Since returning a 400 from a controller doesn't trigger an exception, you will need to configure this status code: builder.Services.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.HandledStatusCodesToLog = new List<int> { 400 }; } The list can also be configured through appsettings.json : { // ... \"ElmahIo\": { // ... \"HandledStatusCodesToLog\": [ 400 ], } } When configuring status codes through the appsettings.json file, 404 s will always be logged. To avoid this, configure the list in C# as shown above. Logging through a proxy Since ASP.NET Core no longer support proxy configuration through web.config , you can log to elmah.io by configuring a proxy manually: builder.Services.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.WebProxy = new System.Net.WebProxy(\"localhost\", 8888); } In this example, the elmah.io client routes all traffic through http://localhost:8000 . ASP.NET Core 8 The Elmah.Io.AspNetCore package can be installed exactly how it is described above in ASP.NET Core 8. We still recommend doing that, so if you don't experience any problems with this approach, there's no need to read this section (unless you are just curious). ASP.NET Core 8 introduces a new way of logging and handling exceptions: IExceptionHandler . You have probably already seen a line similar to this in the Program.cs file: app.UseExceptionHandler(\"/Error\"); This installs the exception-handling middleware bundled with ASP.NET Core. The new feature provides you with the possibility of registering custom exception handlers run as part of the built-in middleware. This is done by registering one or more classes that implement the IExceptionHandler interface. The Elmah.Io.AspNetCore package bundles such a class from version 5.1 and forward. To install it, include the following code in the Program.cs file: builder.Services.AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; options.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); }); builder.Services.AddExceptionHandler<ElmahIoExceptionHandler>(); The AddElmahIo method will set up the dependencies as usual and the AddExceptionHandler method will register an exception handler logging exceptions to elmah.io. You still need to call the UseExceptionHandler method with either a path or empty options: app.UseExceptionHandler(\"/Error\"); // or app.UseExceptionHandler(_ => {}); Calling the overload of UseExceptionHandler without any parameters will not work here. As already mentioned, we only recommend using this code if the normal approach doesn't work. We may switch over to using this approach later on but the code is currently experimental. One advantage of using the exception handler over the elmah.io middleware is to avoid the scenario where you want to use both the elmah.io and exception handler middleware. As an example, this code will not work: app.UseElmahIo(); app.UseExceptionHandler(\"/Error\"); This is because the exception handle \"swallows\" all exceptions before the elmah.io middleware is notified. Registering the ElmahIoExceptionHandler class and not calling UseElmahIo will fix this problem.

To solve this, Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging supports a property named Synchronous that disables the internal message queue and stores log messages in a synchronous way. You may still experience log messages not being stored, but that's a consequence of AWS's choice of killing the process rather than shutting it down nicely (like ASP.NET Core). To log messages synchronously, include the following code in your logging setup: builder.Services.AddLogging(logging => { logging.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.Synchronous = true; }); }); Be aware that logging a large number of log messages synchronously, may slow down your application and/or cause thread exhaustion. We recommend only logging errors this way and not debug, information, and similar.","title":"Logging when using Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer.Hosting"},{"location":"logging-to-elmah-io-from-aws-lambdas/#logging-from-aws-lambda-project","text":"AWS Lambda Project comes with native support for CloudWatch too.

To configure elmah.io, open the Startup.cs file or create a new one if not already there. In the Configure -method, add the elmah.io options and exception filter: using Elmah.Io.Functions; using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions.DependencyInjection; using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host; using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration; using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection; using System; [assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(MyFunction.Startup))] namespace MyFunction { public class Startup : FunctionsStartup { public override void Configure(IFunctionsHostBuilder builder) { var config = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"local.settings.json\", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true) .AddEnvironmentVariables() .Build(); builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoFunctionOptions>(o => { o.ApiKey = config[\"apiKey\"]; o.LogId = new Guid(config[\"logId\"]); }); builder.Services.AddSingleton<IFunctionFilter, ElmahIoExceptionFilter>(); } } } Notice how API key and log ID are configured through the ElmahIoFunctionOptions object. In the last line of the Configure -method, the ElmahIoExceptionFilter -filter is configured. This filter will automatically catch any exception caused by your filter and log it to elmah.io. A quick comment about the obsolete warning showed when using the package. Microsoft marked IFunctionFilter as obsolete. Not because it will be removed, but because they may change the way attributes work in functions in the future. For now, you can suppress this warning with the following code: #pragma warning disable CS0618 // Type or member is obsolete builder.Services.AddSingleton<IFunctionFilter, ElmahIoExceptionFilter>(); #pragma warning restore CS0618 // Type or member is obsolete In your settings, add the apiKey and logId variables: { // ... \"Values\": { // ... \"apiKey\": \"API_KEY\", \"logId\": \"LOG_ID\" } } Replace API_KEY with your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID ( Where is my log ID? ) with your log ID. When running on Azure or similar, you can overwrite apiKey and logId with application settings or environment variables as already thoroughly documented on Microsoft's documentation. Application name To set the application name on all errors, set the Application property during initialization: builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoFunctionOptions>(o => { o.ApiKey = config[\"apiKey\"]; o.LogId = new Guid(config[\"logId\"]); o.Application = \"MyFunction\"; }); Message hooks Elmah.Io.Functions provide message hooks similar to the integrations with ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core. Decorating log messages To include additional information on log messages, you can use the OnMessage event when initializing ElmahIoFunctionOptions : builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoFunctionOptions>(o => { o.ApiKey = config[\"apiKey\"]; o.LogId = new Guid(config[\"logId\"]); o.OnMessage = msg => { msg.Version = \"1.0.0\"; }; }); The example above includes a version number on all errors. Include source code You can use the OnMessage action to include source code to log messages. This will require a stack trace in the Detail property with filenames and line numbers in it. There are multiple ways of including source code to log messages. In short, you will need to install the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode NuGet package and call the WithSourceCodeFromPdb method in the OnMessage action: builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoFunctionOptions>(o => { o.OnMessage = msg => { msg.WithSourceCodeFromPdb(); }; }); Check out How to include source code in log messages for additional requirements to make source code show up on elmah.io. Handle errors To handle any errors happening while processing a log message, you can use the OnError event when initializing ElmahIoFunctionOptions : builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoFunctionOptions>(o => { o.ApiKey = config[\"apiKey\"]; o.LogId = new Guid(config[\"logId\"]); o.OnError = (msg, ex) => { logger.LogError(ex, ex.Message); }; }); The example above logs any errors during communication with elmah.io to a local log. Error filtering To ignore specific errors based on their content, you can use the OnFilter event when initializing ElmahIoFunctionOptions : builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoFunctionOptions>(o => { o.ApiKey = config[\"apiKey\"]; o.LogId = new Guid(config[\"logId\"]); o.OnFilter = msg => { return msg.Method == \"GET\"; }; }); The example above ignores any errors generated during an HTTP GET request. Logging through ILogger Azure Functions can log through Microsoft.Extensions.Logging (MEL) too. By adding the filter, as shown above, all uncaught exceptions are automatically logged. But when configuring your Function app to log through MEL, custom messages can be logged through the ILogger interface. Furthermore, you will get detailed log messages from within the Function host. To set this up, install the Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging Install-Package Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging Then extend your Startup.cs file like this: builder.Services.AddLogging(logging => { logging.AddElmahIo(o => { o.ApiKey = config[\"apiKey\"]; o.LogId = new Guid(config[\"logId\"]); }); logging.AddFilter<ElmahIoLoggerProvider>(null, LogLevel.Warning); }); In the example, only warning messages and above are logged to elmah.io. You can remove the filter or set another log level if you want to log more. Jump to Log filtering to learn how to configure filters from config. Either pass an ILogger to your function method: public class MyFunction { public static void Run([TimerTrigger(\"...\")]TimerInfo myTimer, ILogger log) { log.LogWarning(\"This is a warning\"); } } Or inject an ILoggerFactory and create a logger as part of the constructor: public class MyFunction { private readonly ILogger log; public Function1(ILoggerFactory loggerFactory) { this.log = loggerFactory.CreateLogger(\"MyFunction\"); } public void Run([TimerTrigger(\"...\")]TimerInfo myTimer) { log.LogWarning(\"This is a warning\"); } } Log filtering The code above filters out all log messages with a severity lower than Warning . You can use all of the log filtering capabilities of Microsoft.Extensions.Logging to enable and disable various log levels from multiple categories. A common requirement is to only log Warning and more severe originating from the Azure Functions runtime, but log Information messages from your function code. This can be enabled through a custom category: public class MyFunction { private readonly ILogger log; public Function1(ILoggerFactory loggerFactory) { this.log = loggerFactory.CreateLogger(\"MyFunction\"); } public void Run([TimerTrigger(\"...\")]TimerInfo myTimer) { log.LogInformation(\"This is an information message\"); } } The MyFunction category will need configuration in either C# or in the host.json file: { // ... \"logging\": { \"logLevel\": { \"default\": \"Warning\", \"MyFunction\": \"Information\" } } } Azure Functions v1 The recent Elmah.Io.Functions package no longer supports Azure Functions v1.

As shown in the sections above, using server-side rendering needs Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging while client-side rendering needs Elmah.Io.Blazor.Wasm . You cannot have both packages installed and configured in the same project so you need to stick to one of them for Blazor (United) Apps. Since the Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging package doesn't work with Blazor WebAssembly, we recommend installing the Elmah.Io.Blazor.Wasm package if you want to log from both server-side and client-side.

You can include the current URL on manual log statements by injecting a NavigationManager in the top of your .razor file: @inject NavigationManager navigationManager Then wrap your logging code in a new scope: Uri.TryCreate(navigationManager.Uri, UriKind.Absolute, out Uri url); using (Logger.BeginScope(new Dictionary<string, object> { { \"url\", url.AbsolutePath } })) { logger.LogError(exception, \"An error happened\"); } The code uses the current URL from the injected NavigationManager object.","title":"Include details from the HTTP context"},{"location":"logging-to-elmah-io-from-blazor/#blazor-webassembly-app-wasm","text":"To start logging to elmah.io from a Blazor Wasm App, install the Elmah.Io.Blazor.Wasm NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Blazor.Wasm Install-Package Elmah.Io.Blazor.Wasm <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Blazor.Wasm\" Version=\"4.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Blazor.Wasm In the Program.cs file, add elmah.io logging configuration: builder.Logging.AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; options.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); }); Replace API_KEY with your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID with the ID of the log you want messages sent to ( Where is my log ID? ).

Maybe even a stack trace\", Severity = Severity.Error.ToString(), Data = new List<Item> { new Item {Key = \"Username\", Value = \"Man in black\"} }, Form = new List<Item> { new Item {Key = \"Password\", Value = \"SecretPassword\"}, new Item {Key = \"pwd\", Value = \"Other secret value\"}, new Item {Key = \"visible form item\", Value = \"With a value\"} } }); Structured logging Like the integrations for Serilog, NLog and, Microsoft.Extensions.Logging, the elmah.io client supports structured logging: logger.Messages.CreateAndNotify(logId, new CreateMessage { Title = \"Thomas says Hello\", TitleTemplate = \"{User} says Hello\", }); Breadcrumbs You can log one or more breadcrumbs as part of a log message. Breadcrumbs indicate steps happening just before a log message (typically an error). Breadcrumbs are supported through the Breadcrumbs property on the CreateMessage class: logger.Messages.CreateAndNotify(logId, new CreateMessage { Title = \"Oh no, an error happened\", Severity = \"Error\", Breadcrumbs = new List<Breadcrumb> { new Breadcrumb { DateTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(-10), Action = \"Navigation\", Message = \"Navigate from / to /signin\", Severity = \"Information\" }, new Breadcrumb { DateTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(-3), Action = \"Click\", Message = \"#submit\", Severity = \"Information\" }, new Breadcrumb { DateTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(-2), Action = \"Submit\", Message = \"#loginform\", Severity = \"Information\" }, new Breadcrumb { DateTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(-1), Action = \"Request\", Message = \"/save\", Severity = \"Information\" } } }); Breadcrumbs will be ordered by the DateTime field on the elmah.io API why the order you add them to the Breadcrumbs property isn't that important. Be aware that only the 10 most recent breadcrumbs and breadcrumbs with a date less than or equal to the logged message are stored. In the example above, only Information breadcrumbs are added. The Severity property accepts the same severities as on the log message itself. Events The elmah.io client supports a range of different events to help carry out common tasks. OnMessage To get a callback every time a new message is being logged to elmah.io, you can implement the OnMessage event. This is a great chance to decorate all log messages with a specific property or similar. logger.Messages.OnMessage += (sender, eventArgs) => { eventArgs.Message.Version = \"1.0.0\"; }; Include source code You can use the OnMessage event to include source code to log messages. This will require a stack trace in the Detail property with filenames and line numbers in it. There are multiple ways of including source code to log messages. In short, you will need to install the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode NuGet package and call the WithSourceCodeFromPdb method in the OnMessage event handler: logger.Messages.OnMessage += (sender, eventArgs) => { eventArgs.Message.WithSourceCodeFromPdb(); }; Check out How to include source code in log messages for additional requirements to make source code show up on elmah.io. Note Including source code on log messages is available in the Elmah.Io.Client v4 package and forward. OnMessageFail Logging to elmah.io can fail if the network connection is down, if elmah.io experiences downtime, or something third. To make sure you log an error elsewhere if this happens, you can implement the OnMessageFail event: logger.Messages.OnMessageFail += (sender, eventArgs) => { System.Console.Error.WriteLine(\"Error when logging to elmah.io\"); }; OnMessageFilter Note The OnMessageFilter event require Elmah.Io.Client version 5.2.* or newer. One or more filters can be set up to easily ignore messages based on their messages. To set up a filter, implement the OnMessageFilter event like this: logger.Messages.OnMessageFilter += (sender, eventArgs) => { eventArgs.Filter = eventArgs.Message.Title.Contains( \"foo\", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase); }; This example sets the Filter property to a boolean indicating if the message should be filtered/ignored or not. In case the log message contains the word 'foo', the message will be ignored. Bulk upload If logging many messages to elmah.io, bulk upload can be a way to optimize performance. The elmah.io client supports bulk upload using the CreateBulkAndNotify -method: logger.Messages.CreateBulkAndNotify(logId, new[] { new CreateMessage { Title = \"This is a bulk message\" }, new CreateMessage { Title = \"This is another bulk message\" }, }.ToList()); Options The elmah.io client contains a set of default options that you can override. Proxy To log through a HTTP proxy, set the WebProxy property: var logger = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\", new ElmahIoOptions { WebProxy = new WebProxy(\"localhost\", 8888) }); A proxy needs to be specified as part of the options sent to the ElmahioAPI.Create method to make sure that the underlying HttpClient is properly initialized. Obfuscate form values When logging POSTs with form values, you don't want users' passwords and similar logged to elmah.io. The elmah.io client automatically filters form keys named password and pwd . Using the FormKeysToObfuscate you can tell the client to obfuscate additional form entries: var logger = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\"); logger.Options.FormKeysToObfuscate.Add(\"secret_key\"); Full example Here's a full example of how to catch all exceptions in a console application and log as many information as possible to elmah.io: class Program { private static IElmahioAPI elmahIo; static void Main(string[] args) { try { AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += (sender, e) => LogException(e.ExceptionObject as Exception); // Run some code } catch (Exception e) { LogException(e); } } private static void LogException(Exception e) { if (elmahIo == null) elmahIo = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\"); var baseException = e?.GetBaseException(); elmahIo.Messages.CreateAndNotify(new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"), new CreateMessage { Data = e?.ToDataList(), Detail = e?.ToString(), Hostname = Environment.MachineName, Severity = Severity.Error.ToString(), Source = baseException?.Source, Title = baseException?.Message ?? \"An error happened\", Type = baseException?.GetType().FullName, User = Environment.UserName, }); } } The code will catch all exceptions both from the catch block and exceptions reported through the UnhandledException event. You'd normally create a shared instance of the elmah.io logger, but in this example, the program will exit just after logging the exception why it doesn't matter. The UnhandledException event is implemented as a last resort to log any errors not triggering the catch block.

To invoke the error handler, add the following service behavior: public class ElmahIoErrorBehavior : IServiceBehavior { private readonly ILogger<ElmahIoErrorHandler> logger; public ElmahIoErrorBehavior(ILogger<ElmahIoErrorHandler> logger) { this.logger = logger; } public void Validate(ServiceDescription description, ServiceHostBase serviceHostBase) { } public void AddBindingParameters(ServiceDescription description, ServiceHostBase serviceHostBase, System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection<ServiceEndpoint> endpoints, BindingParameterCollection parameters) { } public void ApplyDispatchBehavior(ServiceDescription description, ServiceHostBase serviceHostBase) { var errorHandler = (IErrorHandler)Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(ElmahIoErrorHandler), logger); foreach (ChannelDispatcherBase channelDispatcherBase in serviceHostBase.ChannelDispatchers) { ChannelDispatcher channelDispatcher = channelDispatcherBase as ChannelDispatcher; channelDispatcher.ErrorHandlers.Add(errorHandler); } } } The service behavior will look up the ElmahIoErrorHandler and register it with CoreWCF. The code above is hardcoded to work with the elmah.io error handler only. If you have multiple error handlers, you will need to register all of them. Finally, register the service behavior in the Program.cs file: builder.Services.AddSingleton<IServiceBehavior, ElmahIoErrorBehavior>(); Uncaught errors will now be logged to elmah.io. All of the settings from Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging not mentioned on this page work with CoreWCF.

We've created clients specifically for Isolated Azure Functions. If your are looking for logging from Azure Functions (in process) check out Logging to elmah.io from Azure Functions . Install the Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated package in your project to get started: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated Install-Package Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated Include a using of the Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated namespace in the Program.cs file: using Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated; Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated can be configured using both IHostBuilder and IHostApplicatiobBuilder (.NET 9). Select your desired approach below: IHostBuilder IHostApplicationBuilder Next, call the AddElmahIo method inside ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults : .ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults((context, app) => { app.AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; options.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); }); }) Next, call the AddElmahIo method: builder.AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; options.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); }); elmah.io now automatically identifies any uncaught exceptions and logs them to the specified log. Check out the samples for more ways to configure elmah.io. Configuration Application name To set the application name on all errors, set the Application property: .AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.Application = \"MyFunction\"; }); Message hooks Elmah.Io.Functions.Isolated provide message hooks similar to the integrations with ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core. Decorating log messages To include additional information on log messages, you can use the OnMessage action: .AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.OnMessage = msg => { msg.Version = \"1.0.0\"; }; }); The example above includes a version number on all errors. Include source code You can use the OnMessage action to include source code to log messages. This will require a stack trace in the Detail property with filenames and line numbers in it. There are multiple ways of including source code to log messages. In short, you will need to install the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode NuGet package and call the WithSourceCodeFromPdb method in the OnMessage action: .AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.OnMessage = msg => { msg.WithSourceCodeFromPdb(); }; }); Check out How to include source code in log messages for additional requirements to make source code show up on elmah.io. Handle errors To handle any errors happening while processing a log message, you can use the OnError action: .AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.OnError = (msg, ex) => { logger.LogError(ex, ex.Message); }; }); The example above logs any errors during communication with elmah.io to a local log. Error filtering To ignore specific errors based on their content, you can use the OnFilter action: .AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.OnFilter = msg => { return msg.Method == \"GET\"; }; }); The example above ignores any errors generated during an HTTP GET request. API key and log ID in settings In the examples above, the API key and log ID are hardcoded in C#. You typically want to define these in a settings file, environment variable, Azure settings, or similar. The simplest way to do this is to load the values through IConfiguration : IHostBuilder IHostApplicationBuilder var host = new HostBuilder() .ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults((context, app) => { var config = context.Configuration; var logId = new Guid(config[\"logId\"]); var apiKey = config[\"apiKey\"]; app.AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = apiKey; options.LogId = logId; }); // ... }) .Build(); var apiKey = builder.Configuration[\"apiKey\"]; var logId = builder.Configuration[\"logId\"]; builder.AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = apiKey; options.LogId = new Guid(logId); }); You need to specify the logId and apiKey variables in the local.settings.json file as well as the place you use to declare config variables on the environments you publish the function app to: { \"Values\": { \"apiKey\": \"API_KEY\", \"logId\": \"LOG_ID\" } } As an alternative, you can define all elmah.io configuration in a separate object in the local.settings.json file you may already know from the appsettings.json file in ASP.NET Core: { \"Values\": { }, \"ElmahIo\": { \"ApiKey\": \"API_KEY\", \"LogId\": \"LOG_ID\" } } Loading values from a separate object like this requires custom code in the Program.cs file since only variables inside the Values object are automatically loaded by the runtime: IHostBuilder IHostApplicationBuilder var host = new HostBuilder() .ConfigureAppConfiguration(c => { c.SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()); #if DEBUG c.AddJsonFile(\"local.settings.json\"); #endif c.AddEnvironmentVariables(); }) .ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults((context, app) => { app.Services.Configure<ElmahIoFunctionOptions>(context.Configuration.GetSection(\"ElmahIo\")); app.AddElmahIo(); }) .Build(); builder.Configuration.SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()); #if DEBUG builder.Configuration.AddJsonFile(\"local.settings.json\"); #endif builder.Configuration.AddEnvironmentVariables(); // ... builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoFunctionOptions>(builder.Configuration.GetSection(\"ElmahIo\")); builder.AddElmahIo(); In this example, configuration from the local.settings.json file is loaded. Rather than specifying options to the AddElmahIo method, we load the entire ElmahIo section from the config file. When published to a test or production environment, you will need to provide the ElmahIo object in the configuration system provided by the environment. For Azure, you would specify environment variables with a key looking like this: ElmahIo:ApiKey Please note that specifying options like an application name or using hooks is still possible by providing options for the AddElmahIo method. When the API key and log ID are loaded from the config file, you don't need to specify them again. Logging through ILogger Isolated Azure Functions can log through Microsoft.Extensions.Logging (MEL) too. When configuring your Function app to log through MEL, custom messages can be logged through the ILogger interface. Furthermore, you will get detailed log messages from within the Function host. To set this up, install the Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging Install-Package Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging Then extend your Program.cs file like this: IHostBuilder IHostApplicationBuilder var host = new HostBuilder() // ... .ConfigureLogging(logging => { logging.AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; options.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); }); logging.AddFilter<ElmahIoLoggerProvider>(null, LogLevel.Warning); }) // ... .Build(); builder.Logging.AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; options.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); }); builder.Logging.AddFilter<ElmahIoLoggerProvider>(null, LogLevel.Warning); In the example, only warning messages and above are logged to elmah.io. You can remove the filter or set another log level if you want to log more. Jump to Log filtering to learn how to configure filters from config. Either inject an ILogger<> : public class MyFunction { private readonly ILogger<MyFunction> logger; public MyFunction(ILogger<MyFunction> logger) { this.logger = logger; } public static void Run([TimerTrigger(\"...\")]TimerInfo myTimer) { logger.LogWarning(\"This is a warning\"); } } Or inject an ILoggerFactory and create a logger: public class MyFunction { private readonly ILogger<MyFunction> logger; public Function1(ILoggerFactory loggerFactory) { this.logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<MyFunction>(); } public void Run([TimerTrigger(\"...\")]TimerInfo myTimer) { logger.LogWarning(\"This is a warning\"); } } Log filtering The code above filters out all log messages with a severity lower than Warning . You can use all of the log filtering capabilities of Microsoft.Extensions.Logging to enable and disable various log levels from multiple categories. A common requirement is to only log Warning and more severe originating from the Azure Functions runtime, but log Information messages from your function code. This can be enabled by logging as normal in the function: namespace MyNamespace { public class MyFunction { private readonly ILogger<MyFunction> logger; public Function1(ILogger<MyFunction> logger) { this.logger = logger; } public void Run([TimerTrigger(\"...\")]TimerInfo myTimer) { logger.LogInformation(\"This is an information message\"); } } } The generic MyFunction logger will create a logger with a category name of the function class including the namespace. You can configure this in the settings file: { // ... \"Logging\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Warning\", \"MyNamespace.MyFunction\": \"Information\" } } } In previous versions of Azure Functions you would use the host.json file for log configuration. The host.json file is dedicated for configuration of the host and since Isolated Functions are running in a process separate from the host, you will need a new file.

All uncaught errors on your website, are now logged to elmah.io. Options If you prefer configuring in code (or need to access the options for something else), API key and log ID can be configured by referencing the elmahio.min.js script without parameters: <script src=\"~/scripts/elmahio.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script> Then initialize the logger in JavaScript: new Elmahio({ apiKey: 'API_KEY', logId: 'LOG_ID' }); Application name The application property on elmah.io can be set on all log messages by setting the application option: new Elmahio({ apiKey: 'API_KEY', logId: 'LOG_ID', application: 'My application name' }); Debug output For debug purposes, debug output from the logger to the console can be enabled using the debug option: new Elmahio({ apiKey: 'API_KEY', logId: 'LOG_ID', debug: true }); Message filtering Log messages can be filtered, by adding a filter handler in options: new Elmahio({ // ... filter: function(msg) { return msg.severity === 'Verbose'; } }); In the example, all log messages with a severity of Verbose , are not logged to elmah.io. Events Enriching log messages Log messages can be enriched by subscribing to the message event: new Elmahio({ // ... }).on('message', function(msg) { if (!msg.data) msg.data = []; msg.data.push({key: 'MyCustomKey', value: 'MyCustomValue'}); }); In the example, all log messages are enriched with a data variable with the key MyCustomKey and value MyCustomValue . Handling errors To react to errors happening in elmah.io.javascript, subscribe to the error event: new Elmahio({ // ... }).on('error', function(status, text) { console.log('An error happened in elmah.io.javascript', status, text); }); In the example, all errors are written to the console. Breadcrumbs Breadcrumbs can be used to decorate errors with events or actions happening just before logging the error. Breadcrumbs can be added manually: logger.addBreadcrumb('User clicked button x', 'Information', 'click'); You would want to enrich your code with a range of different breadcrumbs depending on important user actions in your application. As default, a maximum of 10 breadcrumbs are stored in memory at all times. The list acts as first in first out, where adding a new breadcrumb to a full list will automatically remove the oldest breadcrumb in the list. The allowed number of breadcrumbs in the list can be changed using the breadcrumbsNumber option: var logger = new Elmahio({ // ... breadcrumbsNumber: 15 }); This will store a maximum of 15 breadcrumbs. Currently, we allow 25 as the highest possible value. elmah.io.javascript can also be configured to automatically generate breadcrumbs from important actions like click events and xhr: var logger = new Elmahio({ // ... breadcrumbs: true }); We are planning to enable automatic breadcrumbs in the future but for now, it's an opt-in feature. Automatic breadcrumbs will be included in the same list as manually added breadcrumbs why the breadcrumbsNumber option is still valid. Logging manually You may want to log errors manually or even log information messages from JavaScript. To do so, Elmahio is a logging framework too: var logger = new Elmahio({ apiKey: 'API_KEY', logId: 'LOG_ID' }); logger.verbose('This is verbose'); logger.verbose('This is verbose', new Error('A JavaScript error object')); logger.debug('This is debug'); logger.debug('This is debug', new Error('A JavaScript error object')); logger.information('This is information'); logger.information('This is information', new Error('A JavaScript error object')); logger.warning('This is warning'); logger.warning('This is warning', new Error('A JavaScript error object')); logger.error('This is error'); logger.error('This is error', new Error('A JavaScript error object')); logger.fatal('This is fatal'); logger.fatal('This is fatal', new Error('A JavaScript error object')); logger.log({ title: 'This is a custom log message', type: 'Of some type', severity: 'Error' }); var msg = logger.message(); // Get a prefilled message msg.title = \"This is a custom log message\"; logger.log(msg); var msg = logger.message(new Error('A JavaScript error object')); // Get a prefilled message including error details // Set custom variables. If not needed, simply use logger.error(...) instead. logger.log(msg); The Error object used, should be a JavaScript Error object . As for the log -function, check out message reference . Note Manual logging only works when initializing the elmah.io logger from code. Logging from console If you don't like to share the Elmahio logger or you want to hook elmah.io logging up to existing code, you can capture log messages from console . To do so, set the captureConsoleMinimumLevel option: var log = new Elmahio({ apiKey: 'API_KEY', logId: 'LOG_ID', captureConsoleMinimumLevel: 'error' }); console.error('This is an %s message.', 'error'); captureConsoleMinimumLevel can be set to one of the following values: none : will disable logging from console (default). debug : will capture logging from console.debug , console.info , console.warn , console.error . info : will capture logging from console.info , console.warn , console.error . warn : will capture logging from console.warn , console.error . error : will capture logging from console.error . Note Capturing the console only works when initializing the elmah.io logger from code. Also, console.log is not captured.

In this tutorial we'll add logging to elmah.io from a .NET application with log4net.

Remember to replace API_KEY ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID ( Where is my log ID? ) with your actual log Id. To start logging, write your usual log4net log statements: var log = log4net.LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(HomeController)); try { log.Info(\"Trying something\"); throw new ApplicationException(); } catch (ApplicationException ex) { log.Error(\"Error happening\", ex); } Logging custom properties log4net offers a feature called context properties. With context properties, you can log additional key/value pairs with every log message. The elmah.io appender for log4net, supports context properties as well. Context properties are handled like custom properties in the elmah.io UI. Let's utilize two different hooks in log4net, to add context properties to elmah.io: log4net.GlobalContext.Properties[\"ApplicationIdentifier\"] = \"MyCoolApp\"; log4net.ThreadContext.Properties[\"ThreadId\"] = Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId; log.Info(\"This is a message with custom properties\"); log4net offer a set of contextual classes, which we use to enrich log messages to elmah.io. When looking up the log message in elmah.io, we see the context properties in the Data tab. Besides the two custom variables that we set through GlobalContext and ThreadContext , we see a couple of build-in properties in log4net, both prefixed with log4net: . In addition, Elmah.Io.Log4Net provides a range of reserved property names, that can be used to fill in data in the correct fields on the elmah.io UI. Let's say you want to fill the User field: var properties = new PropertiesDictionary(); properties[\"User\"] = \"Arnold Schwarzenegger\"; log.Logger.Log(new LoggingEvent(new LoggingEventData { Level = Level.Error, TimeStampUtc = DateTime.UtcNow, Properties = properties, Message = \"Hasta la vista, baby\", })); This will fill in the value Arnold Schwarzenegger in the User field, as well as add a key/value pair to the Data tab on elmah.io. For a reference of all possible property names, check out the property names on CreateMessage . Setting category elmah.io provide a field named Category to better group log messages by class name, namespace, or similar. Category maps to log4net's LoggerName field automatically when using Elmah.Io.Log4Net . The category field can be overwritten using one of the context features available in log4net: log4net.ThreadContext.Properties[\"Category\"] = \"The category\"; log.Info(\"This is an information message with custom category\"); Message hooks Decorating log messages In case you want to set one or more core properties on each elmah.io message logged, using message hooks may be a better solution. In that case you will need to add a bit of log4net magic. An example could be setting the Version property on all log messages. In the following code, we set a hard-coded version number on all log messages, but the value could come from assembly info, a text file, or similar: Hierarchy hier = log4net.LogManager.GetRepository(Assembly.GetEntryAssembly()) as Hierarchy; var elmahIoAppender = (ElmahIoAppender)(hier?.GetAppenders()) .FirstOrDefault(appender => appender.Name .Equals(\"ElmahIoAppender\", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)); elmahIoAppender.ActivateOptions(); elmahIoAppender.Client.Messages.OnMessage += (sender, a) => { a.Message.Version = \"1.0.0\"; }; This rather ugly piece of code would go into an initalization block, depending on the project type. The code starts by getting the configured elmah.io appender (typically set up in web/app.config or log4net.config ). With the appender, you can access the underlying elmah.io client and subscribe to the OnMessage event. This let you trigger a small piece of code, just before sending log messages to elmah.io. In this case, we set the Version property to 1.0.0 . Remember to call the ActiveOptions method, to make sure that the Client property is initialized. Include source code You can use the OnMessage event to include source code to log messages. This will require a stack trace in the Detail property with filenames and line numbers in it. There are multiple ways of including source code to log messages. In short, you will need to install the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode NuGet package and call the WithSourceCodeFromPdb method in the OnMessage event handler: elmahIoAppender.Client.Messages.OnMessage += (sender, a) => { a.Message.WithSourceCodeFromPdb(); }; Check out How to include source code in log messages for additional requirements to make source code show up on elmah.io. Note Including source code on log messages is available in the Elmah.Io.Client v4 package and forward. Specify API key and log ID in appSettings You may prefer storing the API key and log ID in the appSettings element over having the values embedded into the appender element. This can be the case for easy config transformation, overwriting values on Azure, or similar. log4net provides a feature named pattern strings to address just that: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name=\"log4net\" type=\"log4net.Config.Log4NetConfigurationSectionHandler, log4net\" /> </configSections> <appSettings> <add key=\"logId\" value=\"LOG_ID\"/> <add key=\"apiKey\" value=\"API_KEY\"/> </appSettings> <log4net> <root> <level value=\"ALL\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"ElmahIoAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"ElmahIoAppender\" type=\"elmah.io.log4net.ElmahIoAppender, elmah.io.log4net\"> <logId type=\"log4net.Util.PatternString\" value=\"%appSetting{logId}\" /> <apiKey type=\"log4net.Util.PatternString\" value=\"%appSetting{apiKey}\" /> </appender> </log4net> </configuration> The logId and apiKey elements underneath the elmah.io appender have been extended to include type=\"log4net.Util.PatternString\" . This allows for complex patterns in the value attribute. In this example, I reference an app setting from its name, by adding a value of %appSetting{logId} where logId is a reference to the app setting key specified above. ASP.NET Core Like other logging frameworks, logging through log4net from ASP.NET Core is also supported. We have a sample to show you how to set it up. The required NuGet packages and configuration are documented in this section. To start logging to elmah.io from Microsoft.Extensions.Logging (through log4net), install the Elmah.Io.Log4Net and Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Log4Net.AspNetCore NuGet packages: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Log4Net dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Log4Net.AspNetCore Install-Package Elmah.Io.Log4Net Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Log4Net.AspNetCore <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Log4Net\" Version=\"5.*\" /> <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Log4Net.AspNetCore\" Version=\"6.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Log4Net paket add Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Log4Net.AspNetCore The version of Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Log4Net.AspNetCore should match the version of .NET you are targeting. Include a log4net config file to the root of the project: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <log4net> <root> <level value=\"WARN\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"ElmahIoAppender\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"ConsoleAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"ElmahIoAppender\" type=\"elmah.io.log4net.ElmahIoAppender, elmah.io.log4net\"> <logId value=\"LOG_ID\" /> <apiKey value=\"API_KEY\" /> <!--<application value=\"My app\" />--> </appender> <appender name=\"ConsoleAppender\" type=\"log4net.Appender.ConsoleAppender\"> <layout type=\"log4net.Layout.PatternLayout\"> <conversionPattern value=\"%date [%thread] %-5level %logger [%property{NDC}] - %message%newline\" /> </layout> </appender> </log4net> In the Program.cs file, make sure to set up log4net: builder.Logging.AddLog4Net(); All internal logging from ASP.NET Core, as well as manual logging you create through the ILogger interface, now goes directly into elmah.io. A common request is to include all of the HTTP contextual information you usually get logged when using a package like Elmah.Io.AspNetCore . We have developed a specialized NuGet package to include cookies, server variables, etc. when logging through log4net from ASP.NET Core. To set it up, install the Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.Log4Net NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.Log4Net Install-Package Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.Log4Net <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.Log4Net\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.Log4Net Finally, make sure to call the UseElmahIoLog4Net method in the Program.cs file: // ... Exception handling middleware app.UseElmahIoLog4Net(); // ... UseMvc etc. log4net Troubleshooting Here are some things to try out if logging from log4net to elmah.io doesn't work: Run the diagnose command with the elmah.io CLI as shown here: Diagnose potential problems with an elmah.io installation . Make sure that you have the newest Elmah.Io.Log4Net and Elmah.Io.Client packages installed. Make sure to include all of the configuration from the example above. That includes both the <root> and <appender> element. Make sure that the API key is valid and allow the Messages | Write permission . Make sure to include a valid log ID.

In the following code, we set a hard-coded version number on all log messages, but the value could come from assembly info, a text file, or similar: Hierarchy hier = log4net.LogManager.GetRepository(Assembly.GetEntryAssembly()) as Hierarchy; var elmahIoAppender = (ElmahIoAppender)(hier?.GetAppenders()) .FirstOrDefault(appender => appender.Name .Equals(\"ElmahIoAppender\", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)); elmahIoAppender.ActivateOptions(); elmahIoAppender.Client.Messages.OnMessage += (sender, a) => { a.Message.Version = \"1.0.0\"; }; This rather ugly piece of code would go into an initalization block, depending on the project type. The code starts by getting the configured elmah.io appender (typically set up in web/app.config or log4net.config ). With the appender, you can access the underlying elmah.io client and subscribe to the OnMessage event. This let you trigger a small piece of code, just before sending log messages to elmah.io.

Start by installing the Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging Install-Package Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging Locate your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and log ID. The two values will be referenced as API_KEY and LOG_ID ( Where is my log ID? ) in the following. Logging from ASP.NET Core In the Program.cs file, add a new using statement: using Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging; Then call the AddElmahIo -method as shown here: builder.Logging.AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; options.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); }); builder.Logging.AddFilter<ElmahIoLoggerProvider>(null, LogLevel.Warning); By calling, the AddFilter -method, you ensure that only warnings and up are logged to elmah.io. The API key and log ID can also be configured in appsettings.json : { // ... \"ElmahIo\": { \"ApiKey\": \"API_KEY\", \"LogId\": \"LOG_ID\" } } To tell Microsoft.Extensions.Logging to use configuration from the appsettings.json file, include the following code in Program.cs : builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoProviderOptions>(builder.Configuration.GetSection(\"ElmahIo\")); builder.Logging.AddConfiguration(builder.Configuration.GetSection(\"Logging\")); builder.Logging.AddElmahIo(); The first line fetches elmah.io configuration from the ElmahIo object in the appsettings.json file. The second line configures log levels in Microsoft.Extensions.Logging from the Logging object in appsettings.json . The third line adds the elmah.io logger to Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. Notice how the overload without any options object is called since options are already loaded from appsettings.json . Start logging messages by injecting an ILogger in your controllers: public class HomeController : Controller { private readonly ILogger<HomeController> logger; public HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger) { this.logger = logger; } public IActionResult Index() { logger.LogWarning(\"Request to index\"); return View(); } } Include HTTP context A common use case for using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging is part of an ASP.NET Core project. When combining the two, you would expect the log messages to contain relevant information from the HTTP context (like URL, status code, cookies, etc.). This is not the case out of the box, since Microsoft.Extensions.Logging doesn't know which project type includes it. Note Logging HTTP context requires Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging version 3.6.x or newer. To add HTTP context properties to log messages when logging from ASP.NET Core, install the Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.ExtensionsLogging NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.ExtensionsLogging Install-Package Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.ExtensionsLogging <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.ExtensionsLogging\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.ExtensionsLogging Then call the UseElmahIoExtensionsLogging method in the Program.cs file: // ... Exception handling middleware app.UseElmahIoExtensionsLogging(); // ... UseMvc etc. It's important to call the UseElmahIoExtensionsLogging method after any calls to UseElmahIo , UseAuthentication , and other exception handling middleware but before UseMvc and UseEndpoints . If you experience logged errors without the HTTP context, try moving the UseElmahIoExtensionsLogging method as the first call in the Configure method. Logging from a console application Choose the right framework version: .NET >= 6 .NET Core 3 Configure logging to elmah.io using a new or existing ServiceCollection : var services = new ServiceCollection(); services.AddLogging(logging => logging.AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; options.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); })); Get a reference to the LoggerFactory : using var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider(); var loggerFactory = serviceProvider.GetService<ILoggerFactory>(); Create a new LoggerFactory and configure it to use elmah.io: using var loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder => builder .AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; options.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); })); Adding the using keyword is important to let elmah.io store messages before exiting the application. Finally, create a new logger and start logging exceptions: var logger = factory.CreateLogger(\"MyLog\"); logger.LogError(ex, \"Unexpected error\"); Logging custom properties Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging support Microsoft.Extensions.Logging scopes from version 3.6.x . In short, scopes are a way to decorate your log messages like enrichers in Serilog and context in NLog and log4net. By including properties in a scope, these properties automatically go into the Data tab on elmah.io. To define a new scope, wrap your logging code in a using : using (logger.BeginScope(new Dictionary<string, object> { { \"UserId\", 42 } })) { logger.LogInformation(\"Someone says hello\"); } In the example above, the UserId key will be added on the Data tab with the value of 42 . Like the other logging framework integrations, Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging supports a range of known keys that can be used to insert value in the correct fields on the elmah.io UI. using (logger.BeginScope(new Dictionary<string, object> { { \"statuscode\", 500 }, { \"method\", \"GET\" } })) { logger.LogError(\"Request to {url} caused an error\", \"/profile\"); } In this example, a log message with the template Request to {url} caused an error to be logged. The use of the variable names statuscode , method , and url will fill in those values in the correct fields on elmah.io. For a reference of all possible property names, check out the property names on CreateMessage . An alternative is to use the OnMessage action. As an example, we'll add a version number to all messages: logging .AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.OnMessage = msg => { msg.Version = \"2.0.0\"; }; }); You can even access the current HTTP context in the OnMessage action. To do so, start by creating a new class named DecorateElmahIoMessages : public class DecorateElmahIoMessages : IConfigureOptions<ElmahIoProviderOptions> { private readonly IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor; public DecorateElmahIoMessages(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor) { this.httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor; } public void Configure(ElmahIoProviderOptions options) { options.OnMessage = msg => { var context = httpContextAccessor.HttpContext; if (context == null) return; msg.User = context.User?.Identity?.Name; }; } } Then register IHttpContextAccessor and the new class in the Program.cs file: builder.Services.AddHttpContextAccessor(); builder.Services.AddSingleton<IConfigureOptions<ElmahIoProviderOptions>, DecorateElmahIoMessages>(); Setting category elmah.io provide a field named Category to better group log messages by class name, namespace, or similar. Category maps to Microsoft.Extensions.Logging field of the same name. The category field is automatically set when using a typed logger: ILogger<MyType> logger = ...; logger.LogInformation(\"This is an information message with category\"); The category can be overwritten using a property named category on either the log message or a new scope: using (logger.BeginScope(new Dictionary<string, object> { { \"category\", \"The category\" } })) { logger.LogInformation(\"This is an information message with category\"); } Logging with LoggerMessage .NET 6 introduced the LoggerMessage attribute that uses source generators for highly usable and performant log statements. Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging fully supports log messages sent through logger messages. [LoggerMessage(Level = LogLevel.Information, Message = \"Created {UserId}\")] private static partial void LogUserCreated(ILogger logger, int userId); // ... LogUserCreated(logger, 42); This will log a message saying Created 42 to elmah.io. Remember that the class including the LogUserCreated method needs to be declared as partial as well. .NET 8 extends this even further by offering a new LogProperties attribute: [LoggerMessage(Level = LogLevel.Information, Message = \"Created user\")] private static partial void LogUserCreated(ILogger logger, [LogProperties]User user); // ... LogUserCreated(logger, new User { Firstname = \"Tyrion\", Lastname = \"Lannister\" }); By adding the LogProperties attribute to the User parameter, a log message saying Created user will be sent to elmah.io. In addition, the Data tab on the extended log message details will show the keys user.Firstname and user.Lastname with the values from the User object provided for the LogUserCreated method. Include source code You can use the OnMessage action already described to include source code to log messages. This will require a stack trace in the Detail property with filenames and line numbers in it. There are multiple ways of including source code to log messages. In short, you will need to install the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode NuGet package and call the WithSourceCodeFromPdb method in the OnMessage action: logging .AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.OnMessage = msg => { msg.WithSourceCodeFromPdb(); }; }); Check out How to include source code in log messages for additional requirements to make source code show up on elmah.io. Note Including source code on log messages is available in the Elmah.Io.Client v4 package and forward. Options Setting application name If logging to the same log from multiple applications it is a good idea to set unique application names from each app. This will let you search and filter errors on the elmah.io UI. To set an application name, add the following code to the options: logging.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.Application = \"MyApp\"; }); The application name can also be configured through appsettings.json : { // ... \"ElmahIo\": { // ... \"Application\": \"MyApp\" } } appsettings.json configuration Some of the configuration for Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging can be done through the appsettings.json file when using ASP.NET Core 2.x or above. To configure the minimum log level, add a new logger named ElmahIo to the settings file: { \"Logging\": { // ... \"ElmahIo\": { \"LogLevel\": { \"Default\": \"Warning\" } } } } Finally, tell the logger to look for this information, by adding a bit of code to Program.cs : builder.Logging.AddConfiguration(builder.Configuration.GetSection(\"Logging\")); Filtering log messages As default, the elmah.io logger for Microsoft.Extensions.Logging only logs warnings, errors, and fatals. The rationale behind this is that we build an error management system and doesn't do much to support millions of debug messages from your code. Sometimes you may want to log non-exception messages, though. To do so, use filters in Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. To log everything from log level Information and up, do the following: Inside Program.cs change the minimum level: builder.Logging.AddFilter<ElmahIoLoggerProvider>(null, LogLevel.Information); In the code sample, every log message with a log level of Information and up will be logged to elmah.io. Logging through a proxy Note Proxy configuration requires 3.5.49 or newer. You can log through a proxy using options: logging.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.WebProxy = new WebProxy(\"localhost\", 8000); }); In this example, the elmah.io client routes all traffic through http://localhost:8000 . Microsoft.Extensions.Logging Troubleshooting Here are some things to try out if logging from Microsoft.Extensions.Logging to elmah.io doesn't work: Run the diagnose command with the elmah.io CLI as shown here: Diagnose potential problems with an elmah.io installation . x message(s) dropped because of queue size limit If you see this message in your log, it means that you are logging a large number of messages to elmah.io through Microsoft.Extensions.Logging within a short period of time. Either turn down the volume using filters: logging.AddElmahIo(options => { /*...*/ }); logging.AddFilter<ElmahIoLoggerProvider>(null, LogLevel.Warning); or increase the queue size of Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging : logging.AddElmahIo(options => { // ... options.BackgroundQueueSize = 5000; }); Uncaught errors are logged twice If you have both Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging and Elmah.Io.AspNetCore installed, you may see a pattern of uncaught errors being logged twice. This is because a range of middleware from Microsoft (and others) log uncaught exceptions through ILogger . When you have Elmah.Io.AspNetCore installed you typically don't want other pieces of middleware to log the same error but with fewer details. To ignore duplicate errors you need to figure out which middleware class that trigger the logging and in which namespace it is located. One or more of the following ignore filters can be added to your Program.cs file: logging.AddFilter<ElmahIoLoggerProvider>( \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.ExceptionHandlerMiddleware\", LogLevel.None); logging.AddFilter<ElmahIoLoggerProvider>( \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.DeveloperExceptionPageMiddleware\", LogLevel.None); logging.AddFilter<ElmahIoLoggerProvider>( \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.IIS.Core\", LogLevel.None); Be aware that these lines will ignore all messages from the specified class or namespace. To ignore specific errors you can implement the OnFilter action as shown previously in this document.

In the example, we specify the level minimum as Info. This tells NLog to log only information, warning, error, and fatal messages. You may adjust this, but be aware that your elmah.io log may run full pretty fast, especially if you log thousands and thousands of trace and debug messages. Log messages to elmah.io, just as with every other target and NLog: log.Warn(\"This is a warning message\"); log.Error(new Exception(), \"This is an error message\"); Specify API key and log ID in appSettings If you are already using elmah.io, you may have your API key and log ID in the appSettings element already. To use these settings from withing the NLog target configuration you can use an NLog layout formatter: <targets> <target name=\"elmahio\" type=\"elmah.io\" apiKey=\"${appsetting:item=apiKey}\" logId=\"${appsetting:item=logId}\"/> </targets> By using the layout ${appsetting:item=apiKey} you tell NLog that the value for this attribute is in an appSettings element named elmahKey : <appSettings> <add key=\"apiKey\" value=\"API_KEY\" /> <add key=\"logId\" value=\"LOG_ID\" /> </appSettings> Note The appSettings layout formatter only works when targeting .NET Full Framework and requires Elmah.Io.NLog version 3.3.x or above and NLog version 4.6.x or above.

To configure elmah.io in JSON, install the NLog.Extensions.Logging NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package NLog.Extensions.Logging Install-Package NLog.Extensions.Logging <PackageReference Include=\"NLog.Extensions.Logging\" Version=\"1.*\" /> paket add NLog.Extensions.Logging Extend the appsettings.json file with a new NLog section: Elmah.Io.NLog 3.x/4.x Elmah.Io.NLog >= 5 { \"NLog\": { \"throwConfigExceptions\": true, \"extensions\": [ { \"assembly\": \"Elmah.Io.NLog\" } ], \"targets\": { \"elmahio\": { \"type\": \"elmah.io\", \"apiKey\": \"API_KEY\", \"logId\": \"LOG_ID\" } }, \"rules\": [ { \"logger\": \"*\", \"minLevel\": \"Info\", \"writeTo\": \"elmahio\" } ] } } { \"NLog\": { \"throwConfigExceptions\": true, \"targets\": { \"elmahio\": { \"type\": \"elmah.io, Elmah.Io.NLog\", \"apiKey\": \"API_KEY\", \"logId\": \"LOG_ID\" } }, \"rules\": [ { \"logger\": \"*\", \"minLevel\": \"Info\", \"writeTo\": \"elmahio\" } ] } } Replace API_KEY with your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID with the ID of the log you want messages sent to ( Where is my log ID? ). If you haven't already loaded the configuration in your application, make sure to do so: var config = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true) .Build(); Finally, tell NLog how to load the NLog configuration section: LogManager.Configuration = new NLogLoggingConfiguration(config.GetSection(\"NLog\")); elmah.io configuration outside the NLog section You might not want the elmah.io API key and log Id inside the NLog section or already have an ElmahIo section defined and want to reuse that. Splitting up configuration like that is supported through NLog layout renderers: { \"NLog\": { // ... \"targets\": { \"elmahio\": { \"type\": \"elmah.io\", \"apiKey\": \"${configsetting:item=ElmahIo.ApiKey}\", \"logId\": \"${configsetting:item=ElmahIo.LogId}\" } }, // ... }, \"ElmahIo\": { \"ApiKey\": \"API_KEY\", \"LogId\": \"LOG_ID\" } } Notice how the value of the apiKey and logId parameters have been replaced with ${configsetting:item=ElmahIo.*} . At the bottom, the ElmahIo section wraps the API key and log Id. To make this work, you will need an additional line of C# when setting up NLog logging: var config = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true) .Build(); ConfigSettingLayoutRenderer.DefaultConfiguration = config; // \ud83d\udc48 add this line LogManager.Configuration = new NLogLoggingConfiguration(config.GetSection(\"NLog\")); IntelliSense There is support for adding IntelliSense in Visual Studio for the NLog section in the appsettings.json file. Copy and paste the following link into the Schema textbox above the file content: https://nlog-project.org/schemas/appsettings.schema.json Configuration in code The elmah.io target can be configured from C# code if you prefer or need to access the built-in events (see more later). The following adds logging to elmah.io: var config = new LoggingConfiguration(); var elmahIoTarget = new ElmahIoTarget(); elmahIoTarget.Name = \"elmahio\"; elmahIoTarget.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; elmahIoTarget.LogId = \"LOG_ID\"; config.AddTarget(elmahIoTarget); config.AddRuleForAllLevels(elmahIoTarget); LogManager.Configuration = config; The example will log all log levels to elmah.io. For more information about how to configure individual log levels, check out the NLog documentation on GitHub . Logging custom properties NLog supports logging custom properties in multiple ways. If you want to include a property (like a version number) in all log messages, you might want to look into the OnMessage feature on Elmah.Io.NLog . With custom properties, you can log additional key/value pairs with every log message. The elmah.io target for NLog supports custom properties as well. Properties are persisted alongside every log message in elmah.io and searchable if named correctly . One way to log custom properties with NLog and elmah.io is to use the overload of each logging-method that takes a LogEventInfo object as a parameter: var infoMessage = new LogEventInfo(LogLevel.Info, \"\", \"This is an information message\"); infoMessage.Properties.Add(\"Some Property Key\", \"Some Property Value\"); log.Info(infoMessage); This saves the information message in elmah.io with a custom property with key Some Property Key and value Some Property Value . As of NLog 4.5, structured logging is supported as well. To log a property as part of the log message, use the new syntax as shown here: log.Warn(\"Property named {FirstName}\", \"Donald\"); In the example, NLog will log the message Property named \"Donald\" , but the key ( FirstName ) and value ( Donald ), will also be available in the Data tab inside elmah.io. Elmah.Io.NLog provides a range of reserved property names, that can be used to fill in data in the correct fields on the elmah.io UI. Let's say you want to fill the User field using structured logging only: log.Info(\"{Quote} from {User}\", \"Hasta la vista, baby\", \"T-800\"); This will fill in the value T-800 in the User field, as well as add two key/value pairs ( Quote and User ) to the Data tab on elmah.io. For a reference of all possible property names, check out the property names on CreateMessage . NLog also provides a fluent API (available in the NLog.Fluent namespace) that some might find more readable: logger.Info() .Message(\"I'll be back\") .Property(\"User\", \"T-800\") .Write(); If you want to use the normal logging methods like Info and Error , you can do so injunction with the MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext class, also provided by NLog: using (MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext.SetScoped(\"User\", \"T-800\")) { logger.Info(\"I'll be back\"); } This will create the same result as the example above. In NLog 5 MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext has been deprecated in favor of a scope context: using (logger.PushScopeProperty(\"User\", \"T-800\")) { logger.Info(\"I'll be back\"); } Setting application name The application field on elmah.io can be set globally using NLog's global context: GlobalDiagnosticsContext.Set(\"Application\", \"My application name\"); Setting version number The version field on elmah.io can be set globally using NLog's global context: GlobalDiagnosticsContext.Set(\"Version\", \"1.2.3\"); Setting category elmah.io provide a field named Category to better group log messages by class name, namespace, or similar. Category maps to NLog's logger field automatically when using Elmah.Io.NLog . The category field can be overwritten using a scoped property (NLog 5): using (logger.PushScopeProperty(\"category\", \"The category\")) { logger.Info(\"This is an information message with category\"); } Message hooks Elmah.Io.NLog provides message hooks similar to the integrations with ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core. Message hooks need to be implemented in C#. Either configure the elmah.io target in C# or fetch the target already configured in XML: var elmahIoTarget = (ElmahIoTarget)LogManager.Configuration.FindTargetByName(\"elmahio\"); You also need to install the most recent version of the Elmah.Io.Client NuGet package to use message hooks. Decorating log messages To include additional information on log messages, you can use the OnMessage action: elmahIoTarget.OnMessage = msg => { msg.Version = \"1.0.0\"; }; The example above includes a version number on all errors. Include source code You can use the OnMessage action to include source code to log messages. This will require a stack trace in the Detail property with filenames and line numbers in it. There are multiple ways of including source code to log messages. In short, you will need to install the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode NuGet package and call the WithSourceCodeFromPdb method in the OnMessage action: elmahIoTarget.OnMessage = msg => { msg.WithSourceCodeFromPdb(); }; Check out How to include source code in log messages for additional requirements to make source code show up on elmah.io. Note Including source code on log messages is available in the Elmah.Io.Client v4 package and forward. Handle errors To handle any errors happening while processing a log message, you can use the OnError event when initializing the elmah.io target: elmahIoTarget.OnError = (msg, err) => { // Do something here }; The example implements a callback if logging to elmah.io fails. How you choose to implement this is entirely up to your application and tech stack. Error filtering To ignore specific errors based on their content, you can use the OnFilter event when initializing the elmah.io target: elmahIoTarget.OnFilter = msg => { return msg.Title.Contains(\"trace\"); }; The example above ignores any log messages with the word trace in the title. Include HTTP context in ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core When logging through NLog from a web application, you may want to include HTTP contextual information like the current URL, status codes, server variables, etc. NLog provides two web-packages to include this information. For ASP.NET, MVC, and Web API you can install the NLog.Web NuGet package and include the following code in web.config : <system.webServer> <modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests=\"true\"> <add name=\"NLog\" type=\"NLog.Web.NLogHttpModule, NLog.Web\" /> </modules> </system.webServer> For ASP.NET Core you can install the NLog.Web.AspNetCore NuGet package. When installed, the elmah.io NLog target automatically picks up the HTTP context and fills in all possible fields on messages sent to elmah.io. NLog Troubleshooting Here are some things to try out if logging from NLog to elmah.io doesn't work: Run the diagnose command with the elmah.io CLI as shown here: Diagnose potential problems with an elmah.io installation . Make sure that you have the newest Elmah.Io.NLog and Elmah.Io.Client packages installed. Make sure to include all of the configuration from the example above. That includes both the <extensions> (Only needed in Elmah.Io.NLog 3 and 4), <targets> , and <rules> element. Make sure that the API key is valid and allow the Messages | Write permission . Make sure to include a valid log ID. Make sure that you have sufficient log messages in your subscription and that you didn't disable logging to the log or include any ignore filters/rules. Always make sure to call LogManager.Shutdown() before exiting the application to make sure that all log messages are flushed. If you are re-using the logger but only want to shut down the thread that is logging messages or similar you can call LogManager.Flush() which will store all batched messages. Extend the nlog element with internalLogLevel=\"Warn\" internalLogFile=\"c:\\temp\\nlog-internal.log and inspect that log file for any internal NLog errors. System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'Newtonsoft.Json' If you see this error in the internal NLog file it means that there's a problem with multiple assemblies referencing different versions of Newtonsoft.Json (also known as NuGet dependency hell ).

With custom properties, you can log additional key/value pairs with every log message. The elmah.io target for NLog supports custom properties as well. Properties are persisted alongside every log message in elmah.io and searchable if named correctly . One way to log custom properties with NLog and elmah.io is to use the overload of each logging-method that takes a LogEventInfo object as a parameter: var infoMessage = new LogEventInfo(LogLevel.Info, \"\", \"This is an information message\"); infoMessage.Properties.Add(\"Some Property Key\", \"Some Property Value\"); log.Info(infoMessage); This saves the information message in elmah.io with a custom property with key Some Property Key and value Some Property Value . As of NLog 4.5, structured logging is supported as well. To log a property as part of the log message, use the new syntax as shown here: log.Warn(\"Property named {FirstName}\", \"Donald\"); In the example, NLog will log the message Property named \"Donald\" , but the key ( FirstName ) and value ( Donald ), will also be available in the Data tab inside elmah.io. Elmah.Io.NLog provides a range of reserved property names, that can be used to fill in data in the correct fields on the elmah.io UI. Let's say you want to fill the User field using structured logging only: log.Info(\"{Quote} from {User}\", \"Hasta la vista, baby\", \"T-800\"); This will fill in the value T-800 in the User field, as well as add two key/value pairs ( Quote and User ) to the Data tab on elmah.io.

Serilog works just like other logging frameworks such as log4net and NLog but offers a great fluent API and the concept of sinks (a bit like appenders in log4net). Sinks are superior to appenders because they threat errors as objects rather than strings, a perfect fit for elmah.io which itself is built on NoSQL. Serilog already comes with native support for elmah.io, which makes it easy to integrate with any application using Serilog. Adding this type of logging to your windows and console applications is just as easy. Add the Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo NuGet package to your project: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo <PackageReference Include=\"Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo To configure Serilog, add the following code to the Application_Start method in global.asax.cs: var log = new LoggerConfiguration() .WriteTo.ElmahIo(new ElmahIoSinkOptions(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"))) .CreateLogger(); Log.Logger = log; Replace API_KEY with your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID with the ID of the log you want messages sent to ( Where is my log ID? ). First, we create a new LoggerConfiguration and tell it to write to elmah.io. The log object can be used to log errors and you should register this in your IoC container. In this case, we don't use IoC, that is why the log object is set as the public static Logger property, which makes it accessible from everywhere. To log exceptions to elmah.io through Serilog use the Log class provided by Serilog: try { // Do some stuff that may cause an exception } catch (Exception e) { Log.Error(e, \"The actual error message\"); } The Error method tells Serilog to log the error in the configured sinks, which in our case logs to elmah.io. Simple and beautiful. Note Always call Log.CloseAndFlush(); before your program terminates. Logging custom properties Serilog supports logging custom properties in three ways: As part of the log message, through enrichers, and using LogContext . All three types of properties are implemented in the elmah.io sink as part of the Data dictionary to elmah.io. The following example shows how to log all three types of properties: var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .Enrich.WithProperty(\"ApplicationIdentifier\", \"MyCoolApp\") .Enrich.FromLogContext() .WriteTo.ElmahIo(new ElmahIoSinkOptions(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"))) .CreateLogger(); using (LogContext.PushProperty(\"ThreadId\", Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId)) { logger.Error(\"This is a message with {Type} properties\", \"custom\"); } Beneath the Data tab on the logged message details, the ApplicationIdentifier , ThreadId , and Type properties can be found. Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo provides a range of reserved property names, that can be used to fill in data in the correct fields on the elmah.io UI. Let's say you want to fill the User field using structured logging only: logger.Information(\"{Quote} from {User}\", \"Hasta la vista, baby\", \"Arnold Schwarzenegger\"); This will fill in the value Arnold Schwarzenegger in the User field, as well as add two key/value pairs (Quote and User) to the Data tab on elmah.io. For a reference of all possible property names, check out the property names on CreateMessage . Message hooks Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo provides message hooks similar to the integrations with ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core. Note Message hooks require Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo version 3.3.0 or newer. Decorating log messages To include additional information on log messages, you can use the OnMessage event when initializing the elmah.io target: Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .WriteTo.ElmahIo(new ElmahIoSinkOptions(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\")) { OnMessage = msg => { msg.Version = \"1.0.0\"; } }) .CreateLogger(); The example above includes a version number on all errors. Since the elmah.io sink also picks up enrichers specified with Serilog, this example could be implemented by enriching all log messages with a field named version . Include source code You can use the OnMessage action to include source code to log messages. This will require a stack trace in the Detail property with filenames and line numbers in it. There are multiple ways of including source code to log messages. In short, you will need to install the Elmah.Io.Client.Extensions.SourceCode NuGet package and call the WithSourceCodeFromPdb method in the OnMessage action: Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .WriteTo.ElmahIo(new ElmahIoSinkOptions(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\")) { OnMessage = msg => { msg.WithSourceCodeFromPdb(); } }) .CreateLogger(); Check out How to include source code in log messages for additional requirements to make source code show up on elmah.io. Note Including source code on log messages is available in the Elmah.Io.Client v4 package and forward. Handle errors To handle any errors happening while processing a log message, you can use the OnError event when initializing the elmah.io sink: Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .WriteTo.ElmahIo(new ElmahIoSinkOptions(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\")) { OnError = (msg, ex) => { Console.Error.WriteLine(ex.Message); } }) .CreateLogger(); The example implements a callback if logging to elmah.io fails. How you choose to implement this is entirely up to your application and tech stack. Error filtering To ignore specific messages based on their content, you can use the OnFilter event when initializing the elmah.io sink: Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .WriteTo.ElmahIo(new ElmahIoSinkOptions(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\")) { OnFilter = msg => { return msg.Title.Contains(\"trace\"); } }) .CreateLogger(); The example above ignores any log message with the word trace in the title. ASP.NET Core Serilog provides a package for ASP.NET Core, that routes log messages from inside the framework through Serilog. We recommend using this package together with the elmah.io sink, in order to capture warnings and errors happening inside ASP.NET Core. To use this, install the following packages: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Serilog.AspNetCore dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo Install-Package Serilog.AspNetCore Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo <PackageReference Include=\"Serilog.AspNetCore\" Version=\"6.*\" /> <PackageReference Include=\"Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Serilog.AspNetCore paket add Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo Configure Serilog using the UseSerilog method in the Program.cs file: builder.Host.UseSerilog((ctx, lc) => lc .WriteTo.ElmahIo(new ElmahIoSinkOptions(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\")) { MinimumLogEventLevel = LogEventLevel.Information, })); } Now, all warnings, errors, and fatals happening inside ASP.NET Core are logged to elmah.io. A common request is to include all of the HTTP contextual information you usually get logged when using a package like Elmah.Io.AspNetCore . We have developed a specialized NuGet package to include cookies, server variables, etc. when logging through Serilog from ASP.NET Core. To set it up, install the Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.Serilog NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.Serilog Install-Package Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.Serilog <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.Serilog\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.Serilog Then, call the UseElmahIoSerilog method in Program.cs file: // ... Exception handling middleware app.UseElmahIoSerilog(); // ... UseMvc etc. The middleware uses Serilog's LogContext feature to enrich each log message with additional properties. To turn on the log context, extend your Serilog config: builder.Host.UseSerilog((ctx, lc) => lc .WriteTo.ElmahIo(/*...*/) .Enrich.FromLogContext() // <-- add this line ); There's a problem with this approach when an endpoint throws an uncaught exception. Microsoft.Extensions.Logging logs all uncaught exceptions as errors, but the LogContext is already popped when doing so. The recommended approach is to ignore these errors in the elmah.io sink and install the Elmah.Io.AspNetCore package to log uncaught errors to elmah.io (as explained in Logging from ASP.NET Core ). The specific error message can be ignored in the sink by providing the following filter during initialization of Serilog: .WriteTo.ElmahIo(/*...*/) { // ... OnFilter = msg => { return msg != null && msg.TitleTemplate != null && msg.TitleTemplate.Equals( \"An unhandled exception has occurred while executing the request.\", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase); } }) ASP.NET Messages logged through Serilog in an ASP.NET WebForms, MVC, or Web API application can be enriched with a range of HTTP contextual information using the SerilogWeb.Classic NuGet package. Start by installing the package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package SerilogWeb.Classic Install-Package SerilogWeb.Classic <PackageReference Include=\"SerilogWeb.Classic\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add SerilogWeb.Classic The package includes automatic HTTP request and response logging as well as some Serilog enrichers. Unless you are trying to debug a specific problem with your website, we recommend disabling HTTP logging since that will produce a lot of messages (depending on the traffic on your website). HTTP logging can be disabled by including the following code in the Global.asax.cs file: protected void Application_Start() { SerilogWebClassic.Configure(cfg => cfg .Disable() ); // ... } To enrich log messages with HTTP contextual information you can configure one or more enrichers in the same place as you configure the elmah.io sink: Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .WriteTo.ElmahIo(new ElmahIoSinkOptions(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"))) .Enrich.WithHttpRequestClientHostIP() .Enrich.WithHttpRequestRawUrl() .Enrich.WithHttpRequestType() .Enrich.WithHttpRequestUrl() .Enrich.WithHttpRequestUserAgent() .Enrich.WithUserName(anonymousUsername:null) .CreateLogger(); This will automatically fill in fields on elmah.io like URL, method, client IP, and UserAgent. Check out this full sample for more details. Config using appsettings.json While Serilog provides a great fluent C# API, some prefer to configure Serilog using an appsettings.json file. To configure the elmah.io sink this way, you will need to install the Serilog.Settings.Configuration NuGet package. Then configure elmah.io in your appsettings.json file: { // ... \"Serilog\":{ \"Using\":[ \"Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo\" ], \"MinimumLevel\": \"Warning\", \"WriteTo\":[ { \"Name\": \"ElmahIo\", \"Args\":{ \"apiKey\": \"API_KEY\", \"logId\": \"LOG_ID\" } } ] } } Note Make sure to specify the apiKey and logId arguments with the first character in lowercase. Finally, tell Serilog to read the configuration from the appsettings.json file: var configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\") .Build(); var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.Configuration(configuration) .CreateLogger(); Extended exception details with Serilog.Exceptions The more information you have on an error, the easier it is to find out what went wrong. Muhammad Rehan Saeed made a nice enrichment package for Serilog named Serilog.Exceptions . The package uses reflection on a logged exception to log additional information depending on the concrete exception type. You can install the package through NuGet: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Serilog.Exceptions Install-Package Serilog.Exceptions <PackageReference Include=\"Serilog.Exceptions\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Serilog.Exceptions And configure it in C# code: var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .Enrich.WithExceptionDetails() .WriteTo.ElmahIo(/*...*/) .CreateLogger(); The elmah.io sink will automatically pick up the additional information and show them in the extended message details overlay. To navigate to this view, click an error on the search view. Then click the button in the upper right corner to open extended message details. The information logged by Serilog.Exceptions are available beneath the Data tab. Remove sensitive data Structured logging with Serilog is a great way to store a lot of contextual information about a log message. In some cases, it may result in sensitive data being stored in your log, though. We recommend you remove any sensitive data from your log messages before storing them on elmah.io and anywhere else. To implement this, you can use the OnMessage event as already shown previously in the document: OnMessage = msg => { foreach (var d in msg.Data) { if (d.Key.Equals(\"Password\")) { d.Value = \"****\"; } } } An alternative to replacing sensitive values manually is to use a custom destructuring package for Serilog. The following example shows how to achieve this using the Destructurama.Attributed package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Destructurama.Attributed Install-Package Destructurama.Attributed <PackageReference Include=\"Destructurama.Attributed\" Version=\"2.*\" /> paket add Destructurama.Attributed Set up destructuring from attributes: Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .Destructure.UsingAttributes() .WriteTo.ElmahIo(/*...*/) .CreateLogger(); Make sure to decorate any properties including sensitive data with the NotLogged attribute: public class LoginModel { public string Username { get; set; } [NotLogged] public string Password { get; set; } } Setting a category elmah.io provide a field named Category to better group log messages by class name, namespace, or similar. Category maps to Serilog's SourceContext automatically when using Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo . To make sure that the category is correctly populated, either use the Forcontext method: Log.ForContext<Program>().Information(\"This is an information message with context\"); Log.ForContext(\"The context\").Information(\"This is another information message with context\"); Or set a SourceContext or Category property using LogContext : using (LogContext.PushProperty(\"SourceContext\", \"The context\")) Log.Information(\"This is an information message with context\"); using (LogContext.PushProperty(\"Category\", \"The context\")) Log.Information(\"This is another information message with context\"); When using Serilog through Microsoft.Extensions.Logging's ILogger<T> interface, the source context will automatically be set by Serilog. Serilog Troubleshooting Here are some things to try out if logging from Serilog to elmah.io doesn't work: Run the diagnose command with the elmah.io CLI as shown here: Diagnose potential problems with an elmah.io installation . Make sure that you have the newest Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo and Elmah.Io.Client packages installed. Make sure to include all of the configuration from the example above. Make sure that the API key is valid and allow the Messages | Write permission . Make sure to include a valid log ID. Make sure that you have sufficient log messages in your subscription and that you didn't disable logging to the log or include any ignore filters/rules. Always make sure to call Log.CloseAndFlush() before exiting the application to make sure that all log messages are flushed. Set up Serilog's SelfLog to inspect any errors happening inside Serilog or the elmah.io sink: Serilog.Debugging.SelfLog.Enable(msg => Debug.WriteLine(msg)); . Implement the OnError action and put a breakpoint in the handler to inspect if any errors are thrown while logging to the elmah.io API. PeriodicBatchingSink is marked as sealed If you get a runtime error stating that the PeriodicBatchingSink class is sealed and cannot be extended, make sure to manually install version 3.1.0 or newer of the Serilog.Sinks.PeriodicBatching NuGet package. The bug has also been fixed in the Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo NuGet package from version 4.3.29 and forward.","title":"Logging from Serilog"},{"location":"logging-to-elmah-io-from-serilog/#logging-to-elmahio-from-serilog","text":"Logging to elmah.io from Serilog Logging custom properties Message hooks Decorating log messages Include source code Handle errors Error filtering ASP.NET Core ASP.NET Config using appsettings.json Extended exception details with Serilog.Exceptions Remove sensitive data Setting a category Serilog Troubleshooting PeriodicBatchingSink is marked as sealed Serilog is a great addition to the flowering .NET logging community, described as \u201cA no-nonsense logging library for the NoSQL era\u201d on their project page. Serilog works just like other logging frameworks such as log4net and NLog but offers a great fluent API and the concept of sinks (a bit like appenders in log4net). Sinks are superior to appenders because they threat errors as objects rather than strings, a perfect fit for elmah.io which itself is built on NoSQL. Serilog already comes with native support for elmah.io, which makes it easy to integrate with any application using Serilog. Adding this type of logging to your windows and console applications is just as easy. Add the Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo NuGet package to your project: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo <PackageReference Include=\"Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo To configure Serilog, add the following code to the Application_Start method in global.asax.cs: var log = new LoggerConfiguration() .WriteTo.ElmahIo(new ElmahIoSinkOptions(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"))) .CreateLogger(); Log.Logger = log; Replace API_KEY with your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID with the ID of the log you want messages sent to ( Where is my log ID? ). First, we create a new LoggerConfiguration and tell it to write to elmah.io. The log object can be used to log errors and you should register this in your IoC container. In this case, we don't use IoC, that is why the log object is set as the public static Logger property, which makes it accessible from everywhere. To log exceptions to elmah.io through Serilog use the Log class provided by Serilog: try { // Do some stuff that may cause an exception } catch (Exception e) { Log.Error(e, \"The actual error message\"); } The Error method tells Serilog to log the error in the configured sinks, which in our case logs to elmah.io.

Microsoft.Extensions.Logging logs all uncaught exceptions as errors, but the LogContext is already popped when doing so. The recommended approach is to ignore these errors in the elmah.io sink and install the Elmah.Io.AspNetCore package to log uncaught errors to elmah.io (as explained in Logging from ASP.NET Core ).

Web API 2.x Web API 1.x Add the following code to your WebApiConfig.cs file: public static class WebApiConfig { public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config) { // ... config.Services.Add(typeof(IExceptionLogger), new ElmahExceptionLogger()); // ... } } The registered IExceptionLogger intercepts all thrown exceptions, even errors in controller constructors and routing errors. Add the following code to your Global.asax.cs file: protected void Application_Start() { // ... GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.Filters.Add(new ElmahHandleErrorApiAttribute()); // ... } In this case you register a new global filter with Web API. The downside of this approach is, that only errors thrown in controller actions are logged.

This is a nice approach to avoid throwing internal server errors, but it also puts ELMAH out of the game. When catching any exception manually and converting it to a response message, errors won't be logged in elmah.io. To overcome this, errors should be logged manually from your global exception/action filter: public class NotImplExceptionFilterAttribute : ExceptionFilterAttribute { public override void OnException(HttpActionExecutedContext context) { ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(context.Exception); // Now generate the result to the client } }","title":"Logging from exception/action filters"},{"location":"logging-to-elmah-io-from-web-pages/","text":"Logging to elmah.io from Web Pages Logging from ASP.NET Web Pages uses our integration with ELMAH (the open-source project).

The code is the same for both Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms. Android iOS Open the MainActivity.cs file and add the following using statements: using System; using Elmah.Io.Xamarin; Locate the OnCreate method and add the following code before all other lines: ElmahIoXamarin.Init(new ElmahIoXamarinOptions { ApiKey = \"API_KEY\", LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"), }); Replace API_KEY with your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID ( Where is my log ID? ) with the log Id of the log you want to log to.

Open the Main.cs file and add the following using statements: using System; using Elmah.Io.Xamarin; Locate the Main method and add the following code after the call to UIApplication.Main : ElmahIoXamarin.Init(new ElmahIoXamarinOptions { ApiKey = \"API_KEY\", LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"), }); Replace API_KEY with your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID ( Where is my log ID? ) with the log Id of the log you want to log to. Calling the Init method will initialize elmah.io. For more configuration options see the Additional configuration section. Log exceptions manually Once the ElmahIoXamarin.Init method has been configured during initialization of the app, any exception can be logged manually using the Log methods available in the Elmah.Io.Xamarin namespace: try { // Code that may break } catch (Exception e) { // Log the exception with the Log extension method: e.Log(); // or use the Log method on ElmahIoXamarin: ElmahIoXamarin.Log(e); } Breadcrumbs Breadcrumbs can be a great help when needing to figure out how a user ended up with an error. To log breadcrumbs, you can use the AddBreadcrumb method on ElmahIoXamarin . The following is a sample for Android which will log breadcrumbs on interesting events: public class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity, BottomNavigationView.IOnNavigationItemSelectedListener { public override void OnBackPressed() { ElmahIoXamarin.AddBreadcrumb(\"OnBackPressed\", DateTime.UtcNow, action: \"Navigation\"); base.OnBackPressed(); } protected override void OnPause() { ElmahIoXamarin.AddBreadcrumb(\"OnPause\", DateTime.UtcNow); base.OnPause(); } // ... public bool OnNavigationItemSelected(IMenuItem item) { switch (item.ItemId) { case Resource.Id.navigation_home: ElmahIoXamarin.AddBreadcrumb(\"Navigate to Home\", DateTime.UtcNow, action: \"Navigation\"); textMessage.SetText(Resource.String.title_home); return true; case Resource.Id.navigation_dashboard: ElmahIoXamarin.AddBreadcrumb(\"Navigate to Dashboard\", DateTime.UtcNow, action: \"Navigation\"); textMessage.SetText(Resource.String.title_dashboard); return true; case Resource.Id.navigation_notifications: ElmahIoXamarin.AddBreadcrumb(\"Navigate to Notifications\", DateTime.UtcNow, action: \"Navigation\"); textMessage.SetText(Resource.String.title_notifications); return true; } return false; } } Additional configuration Besides the mandatory properties ApiKey and LogId the ElmahIoXamarinOptions provide a range of other configuration parameters. Application The elmah.io integration for Xamarin will automatically use the package name for the Application field. To override this you can set the application name in settings: ElmahIoXamarin.Init(new ElmahIoXamarinOptions { // ... Application = \"MyApp\" }); Version The elmah.io integration for Xamarin will automatically use the package version for the Version field. To override this you can set the version string in settings: ElmahIoXamarin.Init(new ElmahIoXamarinOptions { // ... Version = \"1.0.2\" }); Decorating all messages All log messages logged through this integration can be decorated with the OnMessage action: ElmahIoXamarin.Init(new ElmahIoXamarinOptions { // ... OnMessage = msg => { msg.Source = \"Custom source\"; } }); Filtering log messages Log messages can be filtered directly on the device to avoid specific log messages from being sent to elmah.io with the OnFilter function: ElmahIoXamarin.Init(new ElmahIoXamarinOptions { // ... OnFilter = msg => msg.Title.Contains(\"foo\") }); This code will automatically ignore all log messages with the text foo in the title. Handling errors You may want to handle the scenario where the device cannot communicate with the elmah.io API. You can use the OnError action: ElmahIoXamarin.Init(new ElmahIoXamarinOptions { // ... OnError = (msg, ex) => { // Do something with ex } }); Legacy integration If you prefer you can configure elmah.io manually without the use of the Elmah.Io.Xamarin package. This is not the recommended way to integrate with elmah.io from Xamarin and this approach will be discontinued. Start by installing the Elmah.Io.Client NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Client Install-Package Elmah.Io.Client <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Client\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Client If you are targeting a single platform, you can install the package directly in the startup project. If you are targeting multiple platforms, you can either install the package in all platform-specific projects or a shared project. Additional steps will vary from platform to platform.

Note Each user needs to sign up on elmah.io before being visible through Add user . Jump to Invite new users to an organization to learn how to invite new users. When the new user is visible in the dropdown, click the user and select an access level. The chosen access level decides what the new user is allowed to do inside the organization. Read users are only allowed to view the organization, while Administrator users are allowed to add new users and delete the entire organization and all logs beneath it. The access level set for the user in the organization will become the user's access level on all new logs inside that organization as well. When adding a user to your organization, the user will need to click Accept in an email sent to the address associated with their profile in elmah.io, before you can see their email address in the list of users.

Storing messages in a database like Elasticsearch opens up a world of possibilities. This article explains how to query your log messages using full-text search, Search Filters, and Lucene Query Syntax. Query messages using full-text search Full-text search Search Filters Lucene Query Syntax Field specification Full-text search The easiest approach to start searching your log messages is by inputting search terms in the Search field on elmah.io: We don't want to get into too much detail on how full-text works in Elasticsearch. In short, Elasticsearch breaks the query into the terms nominavi and voluptatibus and tries to match all log messages including those terms. Full-text search work on analyzed fields in Elasticsearch, which means that wildcards and other constructs are fully supported. Full-text queries work great. when you want to do a quick search for some keywords like part of an exception message or stack trace. Remember that the entire log message is search, why a search for 500 would hit both log messages with status code 500 and the term 500 in the stack trace. Search Filters Search filters are built exclusively for elmah.io. They are built on top of Lucene Query Syntax (which we'll discuss in a minute), but much easier to write. Search filters are available through either the Add filter button below the search field or using various links and icons on the elmah.io UI. Let's say we want to find all errors with a status code of 500: Adding the two filters is possible using a few clicks. As mentioned previously, search filters are available throughout the UI too. In this example, a filter is used to find messages not matching a specified URL: Search filters can be used in combination with full-text queries for greater flexibility. Lucene Query Syntax Elasticsearch is implemented on top of Lucene; a high-performance search engine, written entirely in Java. While Elasticsearch supports a lot of nice abstractions on top of Lucene, sometimes you just want close to the metal. This is when we need to introduce you to Lucene Query Syntax. The query syntax is a query language similar to the WHERE part of a SQL statement. Unlike SQL, the query syntax supports both filters (similar to SQL) and full-text queries. All Lucene queries are made up of strings containing full-text search strings and/or terms combined with operators. A simple full-text query simply looks like this: values to search for This will search log messages for 'values', 'to', 'search', and 'for'. For exact searches you can use quotes: \"values to search for\" This will only find log messages where that exact string is present somewhere. Queries can also search inside specific fields: field:value This is similar to the WHERE part in SQL and will, in this example, search for the term 'value' inside the field named 'field'. Both full-text queries and field-based queries can be combined with other queries using AND , OR , and NOT : field1:value1 AND field2:value2 AND NOT field3:value3 You can use operators known from C# if you prefer that syntax: field1:value1 && field2:value2 && !field3:value3 Full-text and field-based queries can be combined into complex queries: field1:value1 && field2:\"exact value\" || (field1:value2 && \"a full text query\") Examples are worth a thousand words, why the rest of this document is examples of frequently used queries. If you think that examples are missing or have a problem with custom queries, let us know. We will extend this tutorial with the examples you need. Find messages with type type:\"System.Web.HttpException\" Find messages with status codes statusCode:[500 TO 599] Find messages with URL and method url:\"/tester/\" AND method:get Find messages with URL starting with url:\\/.well-known* The forward slash, in the beginning, needs to be escaped, since Lucene will understand it as the start of a regex otherwise. Find messages by IP remoteAddr:192.168.0.1 Find messages by IP's remoteAddr:192.68.0.* The examples above can be achieved using Search Filters as well. We recommend using Search Filters where possible and falling back to Lucene Query Syntax when something isn't supported through filters. An example is using OR which currently isn't possible using filters. Field specification As already illustrated through multiple examples in this document, all log messages consist of a range of fields. Here's a full overview of all fields, data types, etc. The .raw column requires a bit of explanation if you are not familiar with Elasticsearch. Fields that are marked as having .raw are indexed for full-text queries. This means that the values are tokenized and optimized for full-text search and not querying by exact values. In this case, a special raw field is created for supporting SQL like WHERE queries. To illustrate, searching for a part of a user agent would look like this: userAgent:chrome And searching for a specific user agent would look like this: userAgent.raw:\"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1944.0 Safari/537.36\" Here is the full set of fields: Name Type .raw Description applicationName string \u2705 Used to identify which application logged this message. You can use this if you have multiple applications and services logging into the same log. assignedTo string The id of the user assigned to the log message. elmah.io user IDs are not something that is published on the UI anywhere why this field is intended for the My errors dashboard only. browser string \u2705 A short string classifying each log message to a browser. The value can be one of the following: chrome, safari, edge, firefox, opera, ie, other. category string \u2705 The log message category. Category can be a string of choice but typically contain a logging category set by a logging framework like NLog or Serilog. When logging through a logging framework, this field will be provided by the framework and not something that needs to be set manually. correlationId string CorrelationId can be used to group similar log messages into a single discoverable batch. A correlation ID could be a session ID from ASP.NET Core, a unique string spanning multiple microservices handling the same request, or similar. country string An ISO 3166 two-letter country code in case we could resolve a country from the log message. detail string A longer description of the message. For errors, this could be a stack trace, but it's really up to you what to log in there. domain string The domain name if it could be resolved from the server variables. hash string A unique hash for a log message. The hash is used for multiple things on elmah.io like the new detection. hidden boolean A boolean indicating if a log message has been hidden through the UI, the API, or a hide rule. hostName string \u2705 The hostname of the server logging the message. isBot boolean A boolean indicating is a log message is generated by an automated bot or crawler. This flag is set manually through the UI. isBotSuggestion boolean A boolean indicating if the log message looks to be generated by an automated bot or crawler. Unlike the isBot field, this field is automatically set using machine learning and is available on the Enterprise plan only. isBurst boolean A boolean indicating if the log message is a burst. Log messages are automatically marked as burst if we have seen it more than 50 times during the retention period of the purchased plan. isFixed boolean A boolean indicating if the log message has been marked as fixed. Log messages can be marked as fixed from the UI. isHeartbeat boolean A boolean indicating if the log message is logged from the elmah.io Heartbeats feature. isNew boolean A boolean indicating if we have seen this unique log message before. isSpike boolean A boolean indicating if the log message is logged from the elmah.io Spike feature. isUptime boolean A boolean indicating if the log message is logged from the elmah.io Uptime Monitoring feature. message string \u2705 The textual title or headline of the message to log. messageTemplate string The title template of the message to log. This property can be used from logging frameworks that support structured logging like: \"{user} says {quote}\". In the example, titleTemplate will be this string and the title will be \"Gilfoyle says It's not magic. It's talent and sweat\". method string \u2705 If the log message relates to an HTTP request, you may send the HTTP method of that request. If you don't provide us with a method, we will try to find a key named REQUEST_METHOD in serverVariables. os string \u2705 A short string classifying each log message to an operating system. The value can be one of the following: ios, windows, android, macos, linux, other. remoteAddr string \u2705 The IP address of the user generating this log message if it can be resolved from server variables. severity string An enum value representing the severity of this message. The following values are allowed: Verbose, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Fatal. source string \u2705 The source of the code logging the message. This could be the assembly name. statusCode number If the message logged relates to an HTTP status code, you can put the code in this property. This would probably only be relevant for errors but could be used for logging successful status codes as well. time date The date and time in UTC of the message. If you don't provide us with a value, this will be set the current date and time in UTC. type string \u2705 The type of message. If logging an error, the type of the exception would go into type but you can put anything in there, that makes sense for your domain. url string If the log message relates to an HTTP request, you may send the URL of that request. If you don't provide us with an URL, we will try to find a key named URL in serverVariables. user string \u2705 An identification of the user triggering this message. You can put the user's email address or your user key into this property. userAgent string \u2705 The user agent of the user causing the log message if it can be resolved from server variables. version string \u2705 Versions can be used to distinguish messages from different versions of your software. The value of the version can be a SemVer compliant string or any other syntax that you are using as your version numbering scheme.","title":"Query messages using full-text search"},{"location":"query-messages-using-full-text-search/#query-messages-using-full-text-search","text":"All messages sent to elmah.io, are indexed in Elasticsearch.

Often, underlying configuration issues or missing security headers can lead to vulnerabilities or poor performance. The Recommendations feature collects issues from various elmah.io features to help you improve your software in general. What are Recommendations? While elmah.io is primarily known for error monitoring, the Recommendations features acts as a \"virtual consultant\". It collects issues from various features like uptime monitoring, SSL checks, configuration mistakes, and more that might not result in a 500 error but still impact the quality of your application. You can find the list of Recommendations for each log on the log search page and clicking the Recommendations tab in the top: The list provides a high-level overview of all recommendations categorized by: Impact : Helps you prioritize fixes based on severity. \ud83d\udfe5 High: Critical security issues or major configuration errors. \ud83d\udfe8 Medium: Best practice improvements that should be addressed. \ud83d\udfe9 Low: Helpful tips and minor optimizations. Modified : Shows when the issue was last detected or updated. Message/User count : Displays how many log messages or unique users are affected by the identified issue. You can use the State filter (Open/Ignored/Fixed) and the Impact filter to change the result of the list. Fixing a recommendation Clicking on any recommendation in the list will expand the row to show a detailed breakdown of the problem and how to fix it. Each recommendation includes a description of why the issue matters. For example, a recommendation for a missing header will explain the specific attack vector it helps mitigate, such as XSS or injection attacks. In the example above, a missing Content-Security-Policy header is identified in a URL part of Uptime Monitoring. Managing Recommendation states Once you have identified a recommendation, you have several options for managing it using the icons on the right-hand side of the details view: Mark as Fixed : If you have implemented a fix, click the checkmark icon to move the recommendation to the Fixed state. If the issue is detected again in the future, elmah.io will automatically reopen it. Mark as Ignored : If a recommendation isn't relevant to your specific environment, use the ignore icon to prevent it from cluttering your Open list. Ignored recommendations will not be created again or updated if the issue is still detected. Delete recommendation : Permanently removes the recommendation from the view.

Where Uptime Monitoring is based on us pinging your public HTTP endpoints, Heartbeats is the other way around. When configured, your services, scheduled tasks, and websites ping the elmah.io in a specified interval. We call these ping Heartbeats, hence the name of the feature. Whether you should use Uptime Monitoring or Heartbeats to monitor your code, depends on a range of variables. Uptime Monitoring is great at making sure that your public endpoints can be reached from multiple locations. Scheduled tasks and services typically don't have public endpoints and are expected to run at a specified interval. With Heartbeats, setting up monitoring on these kinds of services is extremely easy, since elmah.io will automatically detect when an unhealthy heartbeat is received or if no heartbeat is received. Click one of the integrations below or continue reading to learn more about Heartbeats: ASP.NET Core Functions Isolated Functions PowerShell cURL Umbraco Hangfire Coravel Worker Services AWS Lambda Scheduled Tasks To better understand Heartbeats, let's create a simple example. For detailed instructions on how to set up Heartbeats in different languages and frameworks, select one of the specific articles in the left menu. In this example, we will extend a C# console application, executed as a Windows Scheduled task, with a heartbeat. The scheduled task is run every 30 minutes. Open a log on elmah.io and navigate to the Heartbeats tab: Click the Add Heartbeat button and fill in a name. For Interval we are selecting 30 minutes since the task is scheduled to run every 30 minutes. For Grace , we select 5 minutes to give the task a chance to complete. Selecting 30 and 5 minutes means that elmah.io will log an error if more than 35 minutes pass since we last heard from the task: To create heartbeats from our task, we will need an API key, a log ID, and a heartbeat ID. Let's start with the API key. Go to the organization settings page and click the API Keys tab. Add a new API key and check the Heartbeats - Write permission only: Copy and store the API key somewhere. Navigate back to your log and click the Instructions link on the newly created Heartbeat. This will reveal the log ID and heartbeat ID. Copy and store both values since we will need them in a minute. Time to do the integration. Like mentioned before, there are multiple ways of invoking the API. For this example, we'll use C#. Install the Elmah.Io.Client NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Client Install-Package Elmah.Io.Client <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Client\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Client Extend your C# with the following code: using Elmah.Io.Client; public class Program { public static void Main() { var logId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); var api = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\"); try { // Your task code goes here api.Heartbeats.Healthy(logId, \"HEARTBEAT_ID\"); } catch (Exception e) { api.Heartbeats.Unhealthy(logId, \"HEARTBEAT_ID\"); } } } Replace LOG_ID , API_KEY , and HEARTBEAT_ID with the values stored in the previous steps. When the code runs without throwing an exception, your task now creates a Healthy heartbeat. If an exception occurs, the code creates an Unhealthy heartbeat and uses the exception text as the reason. There's an additional method named Degraded for logging a degraded heartbeat. Depending on the heartbeat status, a log message can be created in the configured log. Log messages are only created on state changes. This means that if logging two Unhealthy requests, only the first request triggers a new error. If logging a Healthy heartbeat after logging an Unhealthy heartbeat, an information message will be logged. Transitioning to Degraded logs a warning. Additional properties Reason The Healthy , Unhealthy , and Degraded methods (or the CreateHeartbeat class when using the raw Create method) accept an additional parameter named reason . reason can be used to specify why a heartbeat check is either Degraded or Unhealthy . If your service throws an exception, the full exception including its stack trace is a good candidate for the reason parameter. When using integrations like the one with ASP.NET Core Health Checks, the health check report is used as the reason for the failing heartbeat. Application and Version When logging errors through one or more of the integrations, you may already use the Application and/or Version fields to set an application name and software version on all messages logged to elmah.io. Since Heartbeats will do the actual logging of messages, in this case, you can configure it to use the same application name and/or version number as your remaining integrations. api.Heartbeats.Unhealthy(logId, \"HEARTBEAT_ID\", application: \"MyApp\", version: \"1.0.0\"); If an application name is not configured, all messages logged from Heartbeats will get a default value of Heartbeats . If no version number is configured, log messages from Heartbeats will be assigned the latest version created through Deployment Tracking . Took A single performance metric named Took can be logged alongside a heartbeat. The value should be the elapsed time in milliseconds for the job, scheduled task, or whatever code resulting in the heartbeat. For a scheduled task, the Took value would be the time from the scheduled task start until the task ends: var stopwatch = new Stopwatch(); stopwatch.Start(); // run job stopwatch.Stop(); api.Heartbeats.Healthy( logId, heartbeatId, took: stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds); The value of the Took property is shown in the History modal on the Heartbeats page on elmah.io. Checks Note Checks require Elmah.Io.Client version 5.1.* or newer. Some sites and services implement a range of different checks to decide if the program is healthy or not. Consider an ASP.NET Core website that verifies that both a connection to a database and a service bus can be established. In this example, a failing heartbeat to elmah.io can be decorated with one or more Checks : api.Heartbeats.Unhealthy(logId, heartbeatId, checks: new List<Check> { new Check { Name = \"Database\", Result = \"Unhealthy\", Reason = \"Could not connect to database\" }, new Check { Name = \"Service Bus\", Result = \"Healthy\" }, }); When logging checks in a heartbeat, the elmah.io UI will list each check on the Root Cause tab part of the unhealthy heartbeat error.","title":"Set up Heartbeats"},{"location":"setup-heartbeats/#set-up-heartbeats","text":"Set up Heartbeats Additional properties Reason Application and Version Took Checks elmah.io Heartbeats complements the Error Logging and Uptime Monitoring features already available on elmah.io. Where Uptime Monitoring is based on us pinging your public HTTP endpoints, Heartbeats is the other way around. When configured, your services, scheduled tasks, and websites ping the elmah.io in a specified interval. We call these ping Heartbeats, hence the name of the feature. Whether you should use Uptime Monitoring or Heartbeats to monitor your code, depends on a range of variables. Uptime Monitoring is great at making sure that your public endpoints can be reached from multiple locations. Scheduled tasks and services typically don't have public endpoints and are expected to run at a specified interval. With Heartbeats, setting up monitoring on these kinds of services is extremely easy, since elmah.io will automatically detect when an unhealthy heartbeat is received or if no heartbeat is received. Click one of the integrations below or continue reading to learn more about Heartbeats: ASP.NET Core Functions Isolated Functions PowerShell cURL Umbraco Hangfire Coravel Worker Services AWS Lambda Scheduled Tasks To better understand Heartbeats, let's create a simple example. For detailed instructions on how to set up Heartbeats in different languages and frameworks, select one of the specific articles in the left menu. In this example, we will extend a C# console application, executed as a Windows Scheduled task, with a heartbeat. The scheduled task is run every 30 minutes. Open a log on elmah.io and navigate to the Heartbeats tab: Click the Add Heartbeat button and fill in a name. For Interval we are selecting 30 minutes since the task is scheduled to run every 30 minutes. For Grace , we select 5 minutes to give the task a chance to complete. Selecting 30 and 5 minutes means that elmah.io will log an error if more than 35 minutes pass since we last heard from the task: To create heartbeats from our task, we will need an API key, a log ID, and a heartbeat ID. Let's start with the API key. Go to the organization settings page and click the API Keys tab. Add a new API key and check the Heartbeats - Write permission only: Copy and store the API key somewhere. Navigate back to your log and click the Instructions link on the newly created Heartbeat. This will reveal the log ID and heartbeat ID. Copy and store both values since we will need them in a minute. Time to do the integration. Like mentioned before, there are multiple ways of invoking the API. For this example, we'll use C#. Install the Elmah.Io.Client NuGet package: .NET CLI Package Manager PackageReference Paket CLI dotnet add package Elmah.Io.Client Install-Package Elmah.Io.Client <PackageReference Include=\"Elmah.Io.Client\" Version=\"5.*\" /> paket add Elmah.Io.Client Extend your C# with the following code: using Elmah.Io.Client; public class Program { public static void Main() { var logId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); var api = ElmahioAPI.Create(\"API_KEY\"); try { // Your task code goes here api.Heartbeats.Healthy(logId, \"HEARTBEAT_ID\"); } catch (Exception e) { api.Heartbeats.Unhealthy(logId, \"HEARTBEAT_ID\"); } } } Replace LOG_ID , API_KEY , and HEARTBEAT_ID with the values stored in the previous steps. When the code runs without throwing an exception, your task now creates a Healthy heartbeat. If an exception occurs, the code creates an Unhealthy heartbeat and uses the exception text as the reason. There's an additional method named Degraded for logging a degraded heartbeat. Depending on the heartbeat status, a log message can be created in the configured log. Log messages are only created on state changes. This means that if logging two Unhealthy requests, only the first request triggers a new error. If logging a Healthy heartbeat after logging an Unhealthy heartbeat, an information message will be logged. Transitioning to Degraded logs a warning.","title":"Set up Heartbeats"},{"location":"setup-heartbeats/#additional-properties","text":"","title":"Additional properties"},{"location":"setup-heartbeats/#reason","text":"The Healthy , Unhealthy , and Degraded methods (or the CreateHeartbeat class when using the raw Create method) accept an additional parameter named reason . reason can be used to specify why a heartbeat check is either Degraded or Unhealthy .

For this to work, you will need to publish a valid .map source map file to either your web server or through the elmah.io API. In this article, we go through each of the possibilities. This is not a guide for generating source map files. There's a range of possibilities to help you do that (like gulp ). Publish to your web server The easiest way for elmah.io.javascript to translate minified/bundled stack traces is to publish a JavaScript source map alongside your minified JavaScript file. When logging a message through elmah.io.javascript , a source map is automatically used if there is a .map reference at the end of the file causing the log message/error: var v = 42; //# sourceMappingURL=/script.map This will require you to serve a source map file named script.map together with the minified/bundled file. The .map file doesn't need to be publicly available over the internet, but the elmah.io.javascript package will need to have access to it. Note De-minification from a .map file doesn't work in older browsers (like < IE10). Upload to elmah.io Publishing source map files alongside your minified and bundled files is not always the preferred way of doing things. With both the minified JavaScript file and the source map, someone outside of your organization can reverse engineer your JavaScript. In cases where this would be critical or if you want to limit the size of the published files, you can choose to upload the minified/bundled file and the corresponding source map file on the elmah.io API. When elmah.io receives a stack trace from a minified JavaScript file, we try to de-minify it if a corresponding .min.js and .map file have been uploaded. The code in the following sections will use the following bundled and minified stack trace as an example: Error: You cannot copy to the clipboard at window.copyTextToClipboard (https://foo.bar/bundles/sharedbundle.min.js:69:24978) at MyViewModel.n.copy (https://foo.bar/bundles/viewmodels.min.js:37:37385) at HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous> (https://foo.bar/bundles/sharedbundle.min.js:55:109467) To upload a source map to elmah.io you will need an API key with the Source Maps | Write permission enabled. We recommend creating a new API key with this permission enabled only. For more information about API keys and permissions, check out How to configure API key permissions . Upload through the API Go to the API and insert your API key. The upload source map endpoint accepts a couple of parameters that you will need to get right to make de-minification work. The stack trace contains references to two different bundled JavaScript files with each their .map file. Both source map files should be uploaded to the elmah.io API. For both bundled files, fill in the details as explained here: Parameter Description logId A source map will always belong to a specific elmah.io log. Insert the log ID of that log in this field. If an application is logging JavaScript messages to multiple logs, you will need to upload the files to all those logs. Path This is the relative path to the bundled and minified file. For the example above you will need to specify /bundles/sharedbundle.min.js for the first source map and /bundles/viewmodels.min.js for the second one. You can use an absolute path and query parameters on the URL if you prefer, but this will be converted to a relative path by the elmah.io API. SourceMap The source map file representing the minified file in the Path specified above. MinifiedJavaScript The bundled and minified JavaScript file.

The number of messages is calculated from how many times your applications have called our API and successfully stored a message (in most cases messages equal errors). Deleting messages either one by one or in batches is fully supported, but does not result in a decrease in the current message count. Our costs are primarily around receiving, indexing, and notifying about messages, why we cannot allow someone on a lower plan like the Small Business, to log millions and yet millions of messages and then just clean up regularly. We're sure that everyone understands the challenge here. With that said, we want to help you stay within your message limits. Luckily, there are a lot of ways to limit messages. This article contains a list of the most common tactics to stay below your message limit. Ignore Rules Note Be aware that Ignore rules and filters are only meant as a temporary way of ignoring messages. In case you want to permanently ignore one or more log messages, use client-side filtering . The easiest way to limit logged messages is by ignoring some of them (preferable using client-side filtering). Ignored messages are discarded before they are stored and therefore do not count toward your monthly message quota. Message rules can be configured through the Rules tab on the Log Settings view. Rules consist of a query and an action. The query can either be a full-text query or written using Lucene Query Syntax. To create a new ignore rule, input a query on the Rules tab: All new rules are created with an ignore action as default, why you don't need to click the Then link for this type of rule. In the example above, ignore all messages with a status code of 404 . For more information about the possibilities with rules, check out Creating Rules to Perform Actions on Messages . Filters Filters are Ignore Rules in disguise. With Filters, we have collected the most common ignore rules and made them available as a set of checkboxes. To ignore all messages matching a specific filter, enable one of the checkboxes on the Filters tab on Log Settings: If your website is available for everyone to access, ignoring known crawlers, bots, and spiders is a good idea in most cases. Filtering below warning can also be a good idea unless you are using elmah.io to log all log severities from a logging framework like NLog or Serilog. If staying within the message limit is more important than getting the full picture of the errors generated by your website, there are a couple of filters that will help you with that. The Filter Known filter will make sure that only one instance of each error is logged. If you still want to log multiple instances but stop at some point, the Filter Burst filter will stop logging after 50 instances are logged. Be aware that all messages will have an isBurst set on them as soon as we have 50 instances of the message stored. This means that disabling and enabling this filter will not reset the burst limit. Also, if a message has isBurst set to true, it will only be ignored if the Filter Burst filter is enabled. Finally, you can set a limit on how many errors you want logged to a specific log each month, by inputting a number in the Filter Limit filter. Please notice that using any of these last three filters will cause inconsistent results in different graphs and features (like spike detection). They can solve the problem of logging too much, but it is a sign that you are logging more data than is included in your plan. A perfectly valid solution is to purchase a larger plan, get your logging under control (maybe even fix some errors?), and then downgrade when you are ready. Ignore future messages like this Sometimes you may find yourself on the Search tab with a search result thinking: \"I don't care about these messages\". By clicking the caret next to the query filters, an Ignore future messages like this option is revealed: Clicking this option automatically ignores any future messages matching your current search result. Disable logs Each log can be disabled from Log Settings: Disabled logs are shown as semi-transparent on the dashboard, to help you remember that you disabled a log. Client-side message filtering Most of our clients support client filtering. All of the filtering options described above filter messages server-side. This means that your application still communicates with elmah.io's API and needs to wait for that to answer (even for ignored messages). Filtering client-side from ASP.NET, MVC, Web API, and other frameworks built on top of ASP.NET, can be done using ELMAH's (the open-source project) filtering feature. To filter messages, create a method named ErrorLog_Filtering in the Global.asax.cs file: void ErrorLog_Filtering(object sender, ExceptionFilterEventArgs args) { var httpContext = args.Context as HttpContext; if (httpContext.Response.StatusCode == 404) { args.Dismiss(); } } If you're using ASP.NET Core, our client supports the OnFilter action: builder.Services.AddElmahIo(o => { // ... o.OnFilter = message => { return message.StatusCode == 404; }; }); To help you set up client-side filtering in commonly used logging frameworks, click the button on the log message details toolbar. This will show a dialog containing extensive help on setting up client-side filtering. Monitor current usage We send you an email when you have used 90% of your limit and again when reaching the limit. Monitoring your usage is a good supplement to the emails since you can react early on (by upgrading, ignoring errors, or something else). There's a usage graph on the Organization Settings view: By clicking the information icon above the counter, you will be able to see which logs that are taking up space: Fix bugs Seeing the same error over and over again? Maybe the best idea is to fix it :) I mean, that's the whole purpose of elmah.io: to help you fix bugs. And remember, the fewer bugs you have, the cheaper elmah.io gets. The ultimate motivation! Purchase a top-up Sometimes, a spike in errors can be caused by unexpected events like a black hat bot deciding to bombard your site with requests or a junior dev on your team accidentally enabling verbose logging. In these cases, purchasing a top-up may be a better solution than permanently upgrading your plan. Top-ups can be purchased from the Subscription tab on the Organization Settings page. Top-ups are purchased in bundles of 25,000 messages, valid for the rest of the calendar month. Upgrading to the next plan If you constantly go over the limit, you have probably reached a point where you will need to upgrade to a larger plan. You can upgrade and downgrade at any time, so upgrading for a few months (until you get errors under control) and then downgrading again, is perfectly fine.","title":"Tips and tricks to stay below your message limit"},{"location":"tips-and-tricks-to-stay-below-your-message-limit/#tips-and-tricks-to-stay-below-your-message-limit","text":"Tips and tricks to stay below your message limit Ignore Rules Filters Ignore future messages like this Disable logs Client-side message filtering Monitor current usage Fix bugs Purchase a top-up Upgrading to the next plan Each plan on elmah.io includes a maximum number of messages per month.

One of them is a move to netstandard, which makes the new client usable from .NET Core. With interface changes in the client, upgrading from 2.x to 3.x requires more than simply upgrading the NuGet package. This is a guide to upgrading the Elmah.Io package. Note If you are logging to elmah.io from ASP.NET Core, you are already using the 3.x client. Updating the NuGet package First, you need to upgrade the Elmah.Io NuGet package: Update-Package Elmah.Io This installs the latest 3.x client. After doing so, we recommend updating to the latest Elmah.Io.Client package as well (updating Elmah.Io already updated Elmah.Io.Client but to the lowest possible version): Update-Package Elmah.Io.Client The elmah.io.core package is no longer needed and can be uninstalled: Uninstall-Package elmah.io.core Next, you will need to add your API key to your web.config . Where the 2.x client only required a log ID to log messages to elmah.io, the new API improves security by introducing API keys ( Where is my API key? ).

If you are using the ErrorSignal class from ELMAH (the open-source project) to log exceptions manually, everything works as previously. If you are using methods from the Elmah.Io.Client package, there's a new API documented here: Logging from Console . Elmah.Io.Mvc and Elmah.Io.WebApi When launching the packages for 3.x, we also decided to create two new proxy packages: Elmah.Io.Mvc and Elmah.Io.WebApi.

We have tried supporting most of the existing code from the 3.x packages, but some minor code changes may be needed after upgrading. This guide will go through the changes needed and potential problems when upgrading. You may experience problems where NuGet refuses to upgrade an Elmah.Io.* package. We experienced this when referencing more Elmah.Io.* packages from the same project. Like if you would reference both Elmah.Io.AspNetCore and Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging from the same project. Upgrading in this scenario can be achieved in one of the following ways: Uninstall all Elmah.Io.* packages and install them one by one. Install the 4.x version of the Elmah.Io.Client NuGet package. Then upgrade the remaining Elmah.Io.* NuGet packages one by one. Finally, uninstall the Elmah.Io.Client package. Upgrading Elmah.Io.Client If you are using the Elmah.Io.Client package directly, you can simply upgrade that package through NuGet: Update-Package Elmah.Io.Client This installs the latest 4.x client. Most people are using one of the integrations with ASP.NET Core, Serilog, NLog, or similar. There are new major versions of these packages available as well. Code changes As mentioned, some code changes may be required on your part after upgrading. Most of the API stayed the same, but NSwag generates output differently from AutoRest in some cases. Here's a list of changes needed: Remove any references to Elmah.Io.Client.Models . All generated classes are now in the Elmah.Io.Client namespace. Replace any reference to IMessages , IHeartbeats , and similar to IMessagesClient , IHeartbeatsClient , and similar. Replace any instances of new ElmahioAPI(new ApiKeyCredentials(apiKey)); with ElmahioAPI.Create(apiKey); . The ApiKeyCredentials class was specific to AutoRest and has therefore been removed. Collection types on messages like Data , ServerVariables , etc. are now of type ICollection and not IList . This means you can no longer use indexers on these properties. To use indexer you can call ToList() on each collection. Properties of type DateTime are replaced with DateTimeOffset . This shouldn't require any changes on your part since you can assign a value of type DateTime to a property of type DateTimeOffset . You no longer need to make the following cast: (ElmahioAPI)ElmahioAPI.Create(apiKey) . The IElmahioAPI interface will have all the properties you need from the client. If you for some reason manually installed the Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime package you can remove that after upgrading Elmah.Io.Client to v4. Unless you have other dependencies on Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime . The OnMessageFail event, available on the IMessagesClient interface (previously just IMessages ), does now trigger more often. On v3, this event would only trigger on timeouts connecting with the server, when the server returned 500 , and similar. In v4, the event will trigger on every failing request, meaning a request where the response contains a status code >= 400 . This will make it a lot easier to make smart choices on the client when something fails. An example of this could be to implement a circuit breaker pattern or a local processing queue on the client when the elmah.io API starts returning 429 (too many requests). Upgrading Elmah.Io.AspNetCore Upgrading the Elmah.Io.AspNetCore package can be done through NuGet: Update-Package Elmah.Io.AspNetCore Code changes Besides the changes mentioned in the section about the Elmah.Io.Client package, there's a single change in the Elmah.Io.AspNetCore v4 package as well: The ElmahIoExtensions class has been moved from the Elmah.Io.AspNetCore namespace to the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection namespace. The ElmahIoExtensions class contains the UseElmahIo and AddElmahIo methods that you call in your Startup.cs file. This change should not cause any compile errors. For simple installations without custom options, you can most likely remove the using Elmah.Io.AspNetCore; line from the Startup.cs file. Visual Studio will tell if that line is no longer needed.

This guide will go through the changes needed and potential problems when upgrading. You may experience problems where NuGet refuses to upgrade an Elmah.Io.* package. We experienced this when referencing more Elmah.Io.* packages from the same project. Like if you would reference both Elmah.Io.AspNetCore and Elmah.Io.Extensions.Logging from the same project. Upgrading in this scenario can be achieved in one of the following ways: Uninstall all Elmah.Io.* packages and install them one by one. Install the 5.x version of the Elmah.Io.Client NuGet package. Then upgrade the remaining Elmah.Io.* NuGet packages one by one. Finally, uninstall the Elmah.Io.Client package. Upgrading Elmah.Io.Client If you are using the Elmah.Io.Client package directly, you can simply upgrade that package through NuGet: Update-Package Elmah.Io.Client This installs the latest 5.x client. Most people are using one of the integrations with ASP.NET Core, Serilog, NLog, or similar. There are new major versions of these packages available as well. Code changes We used the major version number upgrade to clean up the double methods problem introduced back when adding overloads with CancellationToken on all async methods. This means that async methods now only have a single version looking similar to this: Task<Message> CreateAndNotifyAsync( Guid logId, CreateMessage message, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) This shouldn't cause any compile problems since the v4 version had the following two overloads: Task<Message> CreateAndNotifyAsync( Guid logId, CreateMessage message) Task<Message> CreateAndNotifyAsync( Guid logId, CreateMessage message, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) In addition, we removed all code marked as Obsolete . Each section below will describe what has been removed for each package. For the Elmah.Io.Client package, the HttpClient property on the IElmahioAPI interface has been removed. If you need to provide a custom HttpClient for the client, you can use the following overload of the Create method on the ElmahioAPI class: public static IElmahioAPI Create(string apiKey, ElmahIoOptions options, HttpClient httpClient) Upgrading Elmah.Io.AspNetCore Upgrading the Elmah.Io.AspNetCore package can be done through NuGet: Update-Package Elmah.Io.AspNetCore Code changes Besides the changes mentioned in the section about the Elmah.Io.Client package, the following obsolete method has been removed from the IHealthChecksBuilder interface: public static IHealthChecksBuilder AddElmahIoPublisher( this IHealthChecksBuilder builder, string apiKey, Guid logId, string application = null) Instead, use the AddElmahIoPublisher method accepting options: public static IHealthChecksBuilder AddElmahIoPublisher( this IHealthChecksBuilder builder, Action<ElmahIoPublisherOptions> options) Upgrading Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo Upgrading the Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo package can be done through NuGet: Update-Package Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo Code changes v5 of the Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo package moves to Serilog 3.

In this article, we will present the possibilities of using the API in a use case-driven approach. For a detailed reference of the various endpoints, visit the API V3 documentation . Security Security is implemented using API keys ( Where is my API key? ). When creating a new organization, a default API key is automatically created. You can create new keys and revoke an existing key if you suspect that the key has been compromised. The API key acts as a secret and should not be available to people outside your team/organization. All requests to the elmah.io API needs the API key as either an HTTP header or query string parameter named api_key like this: GET https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID?api_key=MY_API_KEY Messages Creating messages Before doing anything, we will need some messages to play with. The Create Message endpoint does just that. To create a simple message, POST to: POST https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID with a JSON body: { \"title\": \"This is a test message\" } (replace LOG_ID with your log ID): The title field is the only required field on a message, but fields for specifying severity, timestamp, etc. are there. For more information, check out the documentation . If everything where successful, the API returns an HTTP status code of 201 and a location to where to fetch the new message. If the endpoint fails, the response will contain a description of what went wrong. Forgetting to set Content-Length , Content-Type and similar, will result in an invalid request. Getting a message In the example above, the API returned the URL for getting the newly created message: GET https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID/81C7C282C9FDAEA3 By making a GET request to this URL, we get back the message details: { \"id\": \"99CDEA3D6A631F09\", \"title\": \"This is a test message\", \"dateTime\": \"2016-07-03T14:25:46.087857Z\", \"severity\": \"Information\" } As shown in the returned body, elmah.io automatically inserted some missing fields like a timestamp and a severity. If no severity is specified during creating, a message is treated as information. Searching messages For the demo, we have inserted a couple of additional messages, which leads us to the next endpoint: searching messages. The search endpoint shares the root path with the get message endpoint but only takes a log ID. The simplest possible configuration queries the API for a list of the 15 most recent messages by calling: GET https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID The response body looks like this: { \"messages\": [ { \"id\": \"81C7C282C9FDAEA3\", \"title\": \"This is another test message\", \"dateTime\": \"2016-07-03T14:31:45.053851Z\", \"severity\": \"Information\" }, { \"id\": \"99CDEA3D6A631F09\", \"title\": \"This is a test message\", \"dateTime\": \"2016-07-03T14:25:46.087857Z\", \"severity\": \"Information\" }, // ... ], \"total\": 42 } For simplicity, the response has been simplified by not showing all of the results. The important thing to notice here is the list of messages and the total count. messages contain 15 messages, which is the default page size in the search endpoint. To increase the number of returned messages, set the pagesize parameter in the URL (max 100 messages per request). The total count tells you if more messages are matching your search. To select messages from the next page, use the pageindex parameter (or use the searchAfter property as shown later). Returning all messages may be fine, but being able to search by terms is even more fun. To search, use the query , from , and to parameters as shown here: GET https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID?query=another Searching for another will return the following response: { \"messages\": [ { \"id\": \"81C7C282C9FDAEA3\", \"title\": \"This is another test message\", \"dateTime\": \"2016-07-03T14:25:46.087857Z\", \"severity\": \"Information\" } ], \"total\": 1 } Now only 81C7C282C9FDAEA3 shows up since that message contains the text another in the title field. Like specifying the query parameter, you can limit the number of messages using the from , to , and pageSize parameters. There is a limitation of using the pageSize and pageIndex parameters. The data is stored in Elasticsearch which doesn't allow pagination in more than 10,000 documents. If you need to fetch more than 10,000 documents from your log, we recommend breaking this up into weekly, daily, or hourly jobs instead of changing your job to fetch more than 10,000 messages. In case this is not possible, you can switch from using the pageIndex parameter to searchAfter . Each search result will return a value in the searchAfter property: { \"messages\": [ // ... ], \"searchAfter\": \"1694180633270\", \"total\": 42 } To fetch the next list of messages you can provide the search endpoint with the value of searchAfter : GET https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID?searchAfter=1694180633270 You will need to use the same set of parameters in query , from , and to as in the previous request for this to work. Deleting a message When fixing the bug causing an error logged at elmah.io, you may want to delete the error. Deleting a single error is as easy as fetching it. Create a DELETE request to the errors unique URL: DELETE https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID/81C7C282C9FDAEA3 When successfully deleted, the delete endpoint returns an HTTP status code of 200 . Deleting messages Deleting messages one by one can be tedious work. To delete multiple errors, you can utilize the Delete Messages endpoint by creating a DELETE request to: DELETE https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID The request must contain a body with at least a query: { \"query\": \"test\" } An option for deleting messages by date range is available as well. Check out the API documentation for details. Hiding a message Depending on your use case, you may want to hide a message, rather than delete it. Hidden messages are shown as default through neither the UI nor the REST API. But you will be able to search for them by enabling the Hidden checkbox on the UI. To hide a message, use the _hide endpoint like this: POST https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID/99CDEA3D6A631F09/_hide If successful, the endpoint returns an HTTP status code of 200 . Fixing a message When you have fixed a bug in your code, it's a good idea to mark any instances of this error in elmah.io as fixed. This gives a better overview of what to fix and ensures that you are notified if the error happens again. To mark a message as fixed, use the _fix endpoint like this: POST https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID/99CDEA3D6A631F09/_fix If successful, the endpoint returns an HTTP status code of 200 . This will mark a single message as fixed. In case you want to mark all instances of this message as fixe, include the markAllAsFixed parameter: POST https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID/99CDEA3D6A631F09/_fix?markAllAsFixed=true","title":"Using the REST API"},{"location":"using-the-rest-api/#using-the-rest-api","text":"Using the REST API Security Messages Creating messages Getting a message Searching messages Deleting a message Deleting messages Hiding a message Fixing a message Under the hood, everything related to communicating with elmah.io happens through our REST API.
